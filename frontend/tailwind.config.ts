/**
 * Resolve one theme variable into a Tailwind colour that HONOURS the opacity
 * modifier (`bg-surface-2/60`, `bg-danger/10`, `border-accent-solid/50`).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * Every Aladdin colour is a CSS variable, and a variable is opaque to Tailwind's
 * build-time colour parser: it cannot split `var(--surface-2)` into channels, so
 * it cannot synthesise an alpha. Faced with `bg-surface-2/60` it did not warn and
 * did not error — it emitted NO RULE AT ALL. The class stayed in the markup, the
 * element rendered with no background, and the failure was invisible.
 *
 * That silence had cost real states: table header and row hover, admin nav hover,
 * profile-menu hover, sidebar mode and workspace-switcher selection, the collapsed
 * active rail tile, and EVERY soft badge tone (`bg-accent-solid/15`,
 * `bg-success/15`, `bg-danger/15` …) were transparent everywhere in the product.
 *
 * `color-mix` moves the alpha from build time to the browser, where `var()` finally
 * has a value. It composites against the ACTIVE THEME's own token, so one rule is
 * correct on Limestone and on Carbon — which a hardcoded rgba fallback could never
 * be. Applied to every token (semantic, series and brand primitive) so no future
 * `/NN` can quietly evaporate again.
 */
function alpha(token: string) {
  // `<alpha-value>` is Tailwind's own substitution point: it becomes the modifier
  // (`/60` → `0.6`) when one is present and `1` when it is not, so a single string
  // serves `bg-surface-2` and `bg-surface-2/60` alike. Mixing 100% against
  // transparent is exactly the flat colour, so the no-modifier case is unchanged.
  return `color-mix(in srgb, var(${token}) calc(<alpha-value> * 100%), transparent)`;
}

/**
 * Aladdin Tailwind theme — mirrors DESIGN.md ("The Aperture").
 * Concrete values live as CSS variables in `src/styles/tokens.css`; this file
 * only maps them to Tailwind's scale. Semantic colors are theme-aware (they
 * switch under the `dark` class); `brand.*` are the fixed primitives for the
 * Aperture mark, brand artwork, and verification seals.

           here would be a class that compiles, renders a flat fill, and quietly
           undoes the composition wherever someone reached for it.
