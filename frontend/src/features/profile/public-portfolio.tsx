/**
 * A professional's published work, on their public profile.
 *
 * IT RENDERS NOTHING WHEN THERE IS NOTHING (§12). No empty section, no "no work
 * yet" panel, no count of what is being withheld — a visitor must not be able to
 * tell a professional with no portfolio from one who keeps theirs private, and an
 * empty designed section announces the difference as loudly as a number would.
 * The caller checks `items.length` and simply does not render this.
 *
 * WHAT IT KNOWS is only what the projection carries: an id, a title, an optional
 * description, in the owner's order. There is no visibility flag here to get
 * wrong, no state, no storage key and no owner id — the view does not expose them,
 * so this component could not leak one if it tried.
 *
 * THE IMAGE comes from `/p/media/<id>`, which re-proves publication for that exact
 * object before it serves a byte. So the two halves agree by construction: an item
 * that reaches this list is one the media route will serve, and an item the route
 * refuses is one the list never had.
 *
 * `media` is OPTIONAL and comes from the URL issuer: the same opaque item
 * identity, plus thumb/card variant URLs once they exist. Without it the card
 * uses `/p/media/<id>` exactly as before.
