/**
 * The image on a product card.
 *
 * A finishing catalogue is a catalogue of SURFACES — a buyer picks a floor tile
 * by looking at it, and a grid of grey boxes with names on them is a spreadsheet
 * with extra steps. So where `image_ref` exists, it is shown at a fixed 4:3 ratio
 * so the grid keeps its rhythm no matter what the supplier uploaded.
 *
 * A plain `<img>`, not `next/image`: `image_ref` is a free-text reference a
 * supplier controls, `next/image` would need every possible host allow-listed in
 * `next.config`, and an un-allow-listed host throws at render — one bad reference
 * would take down the whole catalog page. Lazy loading and `decoding="async"`
 * give the part of `next/image` that actually matters here.
 *
 * With no image, the card falls back to a neutral marked panel rather than an
 * empty box or a broken-image glyph: "no photo yet" is information, a broken
 * icon is a bug report.
