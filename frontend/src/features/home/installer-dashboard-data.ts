 * here reads a mock export, and nothing here invents a figure the read layer
 * did not return: a field the backend has no source for yet (rewards levels,
 * needs-action items, the brand ecosystem, learning content, opportunity
 * distance/skill-match) is either omitted or left `null`, which the shared
 * components render as an honest empty state rather than a fabricated one.
 *
 * NOT `server-only`, deliberately, exactly like `features/points/view-model.ts`
 * it builds on: this is a pure row-to-view-model transform, not I/O, so it can
 * be reached from either a Server Component (`features/home/installer-home.tsx`,
 * `app/home/layout.tsx`) or a unit test without tripping the server/client
 * boundary check. The actual Supabase reads it transforms stay behind
 * `server/queries/*`, which IS marked `server-only`.
