/**
 * The supply dashboard's own blocks — the four modules that are not a table, a
 * tile, a chart or the attention queue.
 *
 * They live together because they share one property that governs how all four
 * are written: EACH ONE IS THE HONEST VERSION OF A REFERENCE BLOCK THAT HAS NO
 * BACKEND HERE.
 *
 * The Distributor reference draws an opportunity feed fed by a cross-marketplace
 * matching engine, a market-intelligence panel with regional demand indices, a
 * notification stream, and a Reels rail with view and like counts. This
 * repository has a matching engine (none), a market data provider (none), a
 * notifications table (none) and a video model (none). Four blocks could
 * therefore have been dropped, or four blocks could have been filled with
 * plausible numbers. Both are wrong: dropping them loses composition the seller
 * genuinely benefits from, and filling them invents business intelligence.
 *
 * So each block is rebuilt on the ONE dataset that is real — the requests buyers
 * actually addressed to this organization, and the lines inside them — and where
 * even that does not exist, the block renders an empty state that says so in
 * plain words. A dashboard whose every figure can be clicked through to the
 * record it came from is worth more than one that looks like the reference.
 *
 * All server components; none holds copy of its own.

/**
 * Unpriced requests, read as OPPORTUNITIES rather than as a work queue.
 *
 * This is the same table the attention queue's "price this" rows come from, and
 * showing it twice is deliberate rather than an oversight. The two blocks ask
 * different questions of it: the queue asks "what am I late on", ordered by
 * stage and capped at three per stage, while this asks "what is being asked for"
 * and reads INSIDE the request, one row per product line. A seller scanning for
 * something they can supply well is looking at product and quantity, which the
 * queue never shows — it shows the request's title, because that is what you
 * triage by.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE, AND WHY THE COPY SAYS SO
 * The reference's cards carry a region, a count of "showrooms interested in this
 * product", and an urgency score. `rfq_list` has no location column, there is no
 * cross-buyer interest signal, and nothing scores urgency — so none of the three
 * is drawn. The panel's own hint tells the reader what the list actually is
 * (requests addressed to you), which is the difference between a modest true
 * block and a convincing false one.

                  This is a finishing catalogue: a seller recognises "Galala
                  marble, polished" by looking at it far faster than by reading
                  it, and a column of identical text rows is the slowest possible
                  way to scan for something you stock. It reuses the catalogue's
                  own `ProductMedia` — same 4:3 ratio, same lazy loading, same
                  neutral fallback — inside a fixed-width box rather than being
                  reimplemented at thumbnail size.

                  It is genuinely optional. The image arrives over the existing
                  `rfq_items.product_id` foreign key, which is nullable and
                  RLS-filtered, so `imageRef` is null for any line that is not
                  linked to a catalogue entry the reader may see; ProductMedia
                  then draws its marked placeholder and the row still reads. No

/**
 * Product clips, before the media model exists.

 * `products` carries a single `image_ref` — one still image, a free-text
 * reference — and no video column, no media table and no upload path. The
 * reference's rail shows three clips with durations, view counts and like
 * counts; every one of those numbers would have to be invented, and the videos
 * themselves would have to be the reference's own.
 *
 * The action points at the catalogue, which is a route that exists and the place
 * this will eventually be managed from. It is deliberately NOT labelled "add a
 * video": the catalogue cannot accept one today, and a button that names an
 * action the product cannot perform is worse than no button.

/**
 * The empty state a DASHBOARD CELL gets, as opposed to the one a page gets.
 *
 * `StatePanel` is the page-level version and is wrong here for one measurable
 * reason: it is a fixed-height box (`py-xl`, a 44px icon disc, body text at
 * `text-body`) that sits at the top of whatever contains it. Dropped into a
 * panel that stretches to match a taller neighbour, it left 150px of blank
 * surface beneath itself — the "giant empty space" a dashboard must not have,
 * and the exact thing that makes an honest empty state look like a bug.
 *
 * This one stretches (`h-full`, inside a panel body told to be a flex column)
 * and centres its content, so the space the row's tallest panel dictates becomes
 * deliberate padding around a centred message instead of a void under a small
 * one. It is also quieter — smaller disc, `text-label` body — because a cell
 * that has nothing to report should not shout it at the same volume as the
 * panels either side that do.
