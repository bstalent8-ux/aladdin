/**
 * THE ATTENTION QUEUE — the one block on the supply dashboard that is not a
 * table, a tile or a chart, and the reason the page stops reading as a
 * rearranged Showroom dashboard.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR
 * A seller does not open the workspace asking "how many RFQs do I have"; they
 * ask "what is about to cost me a deal". That question crosses every stage of
 * the pipeline at once — a request nobody priced, a price nobody chased, an
 * accepted price with no order behind it, an order nobody progressed. No single
 * module owns that list, which is exactly why it belongs on the dashboard and
 * nowhere else. The modules below still own the full queues; this owns the
 * TRIAGE.
 *
 * WHY A ROW CARD AND NOT A TABLE
 * The Distributor reference's centre block is the shape being borrowed here: a
 * stack of wide rows, each carrying four or five LABELLED cells and its own
 * action button, rather than a header row with columns under it. Two properties
 * make it right for mixed-stage work that a table cannot have:
 *
 *  1. Every row can label its own date. A table forces one header for a column,
 *     so "required by", "valid until", "accepted on" and "confirmed on" would
 *     have to collapse into a meaningless "Date". Here each cell says what its
 *     own figure means, which is the only honest way to mix four record types.
 *  2. Every row can carry its own verb. "Price this", "Chase this", "Create the
 *     order", "Progress it" are four different jobs; one shared "View" column
 *     would flatten them back into a list of links.
 *
 * It is also, deliberately, the densest thing on the page: the rows carry a
 * leading tone rail, so severity is readable down the left edge in one pass
 * before any word is read.
 *
 * REAL RECORDS ONLY
 * Every item is assembled by the dashboard from records the caller's
 * organization is a party to, and `href` points at the module that owns it.
 * There is no "opportunity" store behind this and no scoring model — the order
 * is the stage order a seller works in, and nothing here is invented.
 *
 * Server-safe (no client hooks).
