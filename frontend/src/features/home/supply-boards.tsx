/**
 * The Supplier Dashboard's own presentation layer.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE MODULE, AND WHY NOT `Panel` / `KpiStrip`
 * The shared workspace primitives are correct and stay correct — every other
 * route keeps using them. They encode a different composition from the one this
 * page is now supposed to have: `Panel` offers a TINTED HEADER BAND to signal a
 * panel's subject, `KpiStrip` gives each metric a card of its own, and the two
 * together produce a page of independent coloured cards with no ranking between
 * them. That is precisely the appearance the approved concept replaces.
 *
 * So this file holds the boards THIS page is composed from: one neutral panel
 * shape, one continuous metric region, an operational row list with material
 * imagery, and three reference modules. It is a presentation layer over data
 * fetched exactly as before — no component here queries anything, and every
 * board takes finished, localized strings, so the file contains no copy and no
 * locale logic.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT: a second design system. Every colour, radius,
 * shadow and type step below is an existing token. Nothing here introduces a
 * value; it only arranges them differently from the way the shared primitives do.

 * dashboard ends up with six differently-coloured cards, each shouting, none
 * ranking. Rank on this page comes from SIZE and POSITION — the attention board
 * is wide and first, the reference modules are a third as wide and last — which
 * is a hierarchy the reader can see without having to learn what red means.
 *
 * The subject is carried by the header icon, which is the one accented mark a
