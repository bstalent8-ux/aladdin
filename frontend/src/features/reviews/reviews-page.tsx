/**
 * `/home/reviews`.
 *
 * COMPOSITION FROM `05-reviews.jpeg`, REVISITED (Increment 14 correction): the
 * reference is a two-column dashboard — a compact continuous list carrying the
 * real work, a supporting rail stating the average, the total and the 5→1
 * distribution beside it — not a full-width summary stacked on full-width
 * cards. `WorkPane` gives it that shape for free: the same primitive Jobs
 * Opportunities already uses for its results-plus-rail geometry, so the two
 * pages read as the same product rather than two different layout systems.
 * The list itself moved from "one bordered card per review with gaps between"
 * to ONE continuous divided surface (`ReviewRow`, no card frame of its own) —
 * the same treatment `PointsHistory` already gives the Points ledger — so five
 * reviews read as a dense record rather than five loosely related panels.
 *
 * WHAT THE REFERENCE HAS THAT THIS DOES NOT, and why each is absent rather than
 * postponed:
 *
 *   * A right rail of per-category scores — quality 96%, punctuality 94%,
 *     professionalism 93%, cleanliness 92%, value 90%. There is ONE rating in
 *     this product. Five more would be five numbers nobody ever entered, and a
 *     professional would be scored on axes no client was ever asked about.
 *   * A "recommended" badge on each row. No such flag exists, and deriving one
 *     from the rating would invent a threshold the reviewer never agreed to.
 *   * A satisfaction percentage, and positive/neutral/negative counts. Both
 *     bucket the same five ratings into a coarser taxonomy nobody chose; the
 *     distribution below says strictly more, exactly.
 *   * A rating-over-time chart and improvement tips. The first is a shape this
 *     increment has no volume to draw honestly; the second is advice the product
 *     has no basis to give.
 *   * An individual client name, face and "verified client" tick. The reviewer
 *     is the ORGANIZATION (§1), and the employee who typed it is never exposed.
 *   * Export and a per-row overflow menu. Nothing to export, and no action a
 *     professional can take on a review — it is immutable and there is no reply.
 *     The list itself pages by CURSOR ("Show more"), `created_at DESC, id DESC`.
 *
 * The reference's second column is not adopted wholesale, though — most of
 * what it holds (per-category scores, a trend chart, tips) is exactly the
 * list above. What IS real from that column — the average, the total and the
 * distribution — is what the supporting rail below carries; nothing in it is
 * a number nobody entered.
