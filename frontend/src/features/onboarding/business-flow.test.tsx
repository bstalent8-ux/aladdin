/**
 * Deterministic UI proof of the business-creation contract:
 *  1. the identity step gates Continue on a business name and persists first;
 *  2. the draft id returned by the first save is carried into every later call —
 *     this is what makes a retry idempotent, so it must not be lost client-side;
 *  3. a business type chosen at registration is NEVER asked again;
 *  4. creating is not gated on an owner/manager confirmation — the creator IS the
 *     owner, so no such question exists.
 * The server RPCs enforce the same rules (pgTAP 27); this pins the client contract.
