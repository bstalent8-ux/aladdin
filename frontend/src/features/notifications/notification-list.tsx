/**
 * THE ONE NOTIFICATION LIST. Rendered in the header panel and in the supply
 * dashboard block, and there must not be a second design of it.
 *
 * The two surfaces differ in DENSITY and in nothing else: same row, same
 * unread cue, same deep link, same read-state behaviour. A dashboard block that
 * invented its own row would be a second thing to keep in step with the header
 * every time the shape of a notification changes.
 *
 * WHY THE ROW IS ONE INTERACTIVE ELEMENT
 * A row is a link, and the whole row is the link — not a link with a "mark read"
 * button inside it. Nesting a button in an anchor is invalid HTML that browsers
 * resolve inconsistently and screen readers announce as two overlapping targets.
 * Marking read is a SIDE EFFECT of opening the notice, which is also the honest
 * model: you have read it because you went and looked at it.

 * Read state converges on the server; this only makes the convergence visible.
 *
 * Clicking a row fires the RPC and then `router.refresh()`, which re-renders the
 * current route AND its layouts — so the header badge, which lives in the
 * layout, updates without a browser reload and without expiring anything else.
 * That round trip is not instant, so the row also records the id locally and
 * reads as read immediately.
 *
 * The local record needs no cleanup. A row is shown as read when the SERVER says
 * so or when it is in `readIds`; once the refresh lands the server says so on
 * its own, and a stale id in the set can only agree with it. Nothing has to
 * decide when to forget.
