/**
 * The professional's discovery surface.
 *
 * The reference board (`02-job-opportunities.jpg`) is the composition this
 * follows: a card per opening, identity and organization leading, the practical
 * facts as a chip row, compensation given real weight, and one action. What it
 * deliberately does NOT follow is everything on that board with no authority
 * behind it — the match percentages, the distances in kilometres, the bookmark
 * hearts, the "most requested" sort and the photographs. Each of those would be
 * a number or an affordance this product cannot honour, and a professional
 * choosing work would reasonably believe every one of them.
 *
 * SO THE CARD SHOWS EXACTLY WHAT THE READ SEAM HOLDS. Title, poster, trade,
 * place, compensation, duration, start, when it was posted, and whether this
 * caller has already applied. Nothing derived, nothing scored, nothing ranked.
 *
 * ONE PRIMARY ACTION. "View details" and not "Apply now": applying is a
 * deliberate act against a stated amount, and the place to take it is the page
 * that states the amount in full — not a card in a grid.
 *
 * DENSITY CORRECTION (Increment 14): the reference packs three of these per
 * row with far less air around each fact than the original pass gave it, even
 * with no photograph to fill. `pad="sm"` and `gap-sm` throughout, and the grid
 * itself opens to three columns once the filter rail's own width is out of the
 * way (from `wide`, 1440px and up) — narrower than that, two stays the honest
 * answer rather than forcing a third column an Arabic label would wrap badly
 * inside.
