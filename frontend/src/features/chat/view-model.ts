/**
 * PERSISTED CHAT ROWS -> UI-READY VIEWS. Presentation only.
 *
 * Nothing here decides who may see a conversation — the database already did,
 * and whatever reached this module survived RLS. Nothing here decides what a
 * conversation MEANS either: the two party organizations, the subject anchor and
 * every timestamp were derived by the approved RPCs and read back as facts.
 *
 * The ONLY judgment this layer makes is PRESENTATIONAL: which of two already-
 * visible names is "the counterparty", and which side of the thread a message
 * was spoken from. Both derive from data this caller legitimately holds (the
 * conversation row itself) compared against their own context ids — the same UX
 * class as Notifications' optional `organization_id`. Neither comparison grants
 * anything: RLS has already returned these rows, and flipping the comparison
 * could not reveal a row the database did not send.
 *
 * MESSAGE BODIES ARE NEVER TOUCHED. They render exactly as authored — Arabic,
 * English or mixed, byte-identical — per chat-core.md §17. System labels around
 * them stay localized.
