/**
 * The ONE personal-account surface. A signed-in caller with no organization —
 * an End Consumer, or an individual professional (Engineer, Interior Designer,
 * Installer/Technician, Contractor, org-less Salesperson) — lands here, and the
 * page is persona-aware rather than consumer-specific.
 *
 * Three guards, all derived, never assumed:
 *   * an account that has not finished onboarding resumes at /onboarding;
 *   * platform staff belong in /admin;
 *   * a caller with NO personal persona has no personal home to show. A
 *     business-only identity is sent to its business workspace rather than a
 *     fabricated, empty Personal one; a caller with neither gets an account-safe
 *     terminal here (never a redirect, which would loop).
 *
 * Crucially, merely BELONGING to an organization no longer evicts the caller: an
 * Engineer who also owns a business keeps a real personal home, and the workspace
 * switcher — not a forced redirect — decides where they work.
 *
 * Reaching this page never depends on a verification decision — completing
 * onboarding activates the account, and trust state is shown, not enforced.
 *
 * SIX REAL READS, IN PARALLEL (Increment 14, plus the installer dashboard's
 * own recent-points-entry read). `loadMyTrades` dropped out of this page's
 * own `Promise.all` — the professional's practice detail moved to the
 * Account Overview, so Home no longer pays for a trades round trip it does
 * not render. What replaced it are the same functions `/home/points`,
 * `/home/reviews`, `/home/network` and `/home/jobs` already call, so the
 * summary strip and the opportunities preview cannot disagree with those
 * pages' own numbers.
