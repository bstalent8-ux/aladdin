 * This layout used to write its own shell: `flex min-h-dvh flex-col bg-canvas`,
 * a horizontal rail under the header, and no atmosphere. That was one of five
 * hand-written copies of an unnamed shell, and it is why a personal account and
 * a showroom workspace read as two different products. The page compositions
 * below are untouched; only the ground and the navigation organ moved onto the
 * canonical foundation.
 *
 * A consumer, or an individual professional, works here and never in the Sales
 * cockpit — that remains true. It was never a reason for a different visual
 * language, only for a different list of destinations.
 *
 * The workspace switcher is the one piece of workspace chrome that belongs here:
 * a person who also owns or works in a business must be able to reach it from
 * their personal surface, and a person who has none needs somewhere to add their
 * first — which is why it is present even for a lone Personal context.
 *
 * THE SIDEBAR MODE COOKIE IS SHARED WITH THE WORKSPACE, deliberately. Someone
 * who collapsed the panel in their showroom expects it collapsed here; the
 * preference is about how much room navigation should take, not about which
 * product they are in.
