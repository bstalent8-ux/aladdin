/**
 * The Account Overview — "my account" in the reference pack's sense: one
 * place that holds the professional identity, a real summary of their
 * standing, what the public can see, and leads to every real account
 * surface (Portfolio, Certificates, Reviews, Points, Network, Work,
 * Settings).
 *
 * IT IS NOT A SECOND `/home`. The dashboard greets, says what to do right
 * now, and shows a preview of open work. This page answers a different
 * question — *what does my account actually say, in full* — which is why
 * publication state and the complete module grid live here and only a
 * compact snapshot strip lives on the dashboard.
 *
 * SIX REAL READS, IN PARALLEL. Points balance and completed-assignment
 * count are new to this page (Increment 14) — the same `getPointsBalance`
 * and `countAssignmentsByStatus` `/home/points` and `/home/work` themselves
 * call, so the summary strip here cannot disagree with those pages' own
 * numbers. `loadMyTrades` dropped out in the composition pass that followed:
 * the canonical trade is now shown (and edited) only on `/home/profile/edit`,
 * so this page no longer pays for a read it does not render.
 *
 * A CONSUMER HAS NO PROFESSIONAL PROFILE, and is told so rather than redirected:
 * there is nothing wrong with the account, the page simply belongs to a different
 * kind of one. Same reasoning as `ShowroomNotAvailable`.
