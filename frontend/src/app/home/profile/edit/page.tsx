 * The standalone profile editor.

 * Hydrated from `getIndividualOnboardingData()` — the SAME read the wizard uses,
 * so the two surfaces cannot show different values for the same profile. State
 * lives in the database, never in a client store, which is what lets a person edit
 * from one device and see it from another.
 *
 * ONE GUARD, NOT TWO. The page admits any professional variant and the database
 * admits any professional identity — canonical or declared (`20260831090003`).
 * There is deliberately no second, narrower frontend condition: the editor briefly
 * carried one, derived from the onboarding track, and it locked out every seeded
 * and Admin-upgraded professional in the Pilot. A frontend gate stricter than the
 * write path is not caution, it is a second rule to keep in step.
