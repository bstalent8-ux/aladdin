/**
 * Points, on the PERSONAL surface — the reachability fix for a feature that
 * shipped complete and then could not be opened by most of the people who hold it.
 *
 * `/b2b/points` was the only Points route, and `/b2b/layout.tsx` redirects a
 * caller with no organization to `/home`. An organization-less installer,
 * engineer or designer therefore held a real, user-owned balance in a real ledger
 * and had no door to it. Points are the caller's OWN standing — never an
 * organization record — so the personal home is where they always belonged; the
 * workspace copy is the one that exists for convenience.
 *
 * NOTHING ABOUT POINTS CHANGES HERE. No schema, no earning rule, no new event, no
 * wallet, tier, level, streak, progress bar, leaderboard or redeem control — the
 * approved contract excludes every one of those and this page adds none. The
 * reads, the failure contract, the history mapping and the negative-balance
 * behaviour are the shipped ones, shared through `features/points/points-page.ts`
 * so the two surfaces cannot drift.
 *
 * WHAT DIFFERS FROM `/b2b/points` IS CHROME ONLY. The workspace page uses the
 * dense `PageHeader`/`Panel` primitives; this one uses `HomeHeader`/`HomeSection`,
 * so it sits with `/home/profile` rather than importing the cockpit's density into
 * a surface that has no sidebar.
 *
 * READ AUTHORITY IS THE DATABASE'S, UNCHANGED. `points_ledger` has one owner
 * policy (`user_id = auth.uid()`), `points_balance()` is called with no argument,
 * and the query layer accepts no user id — so this route can no more reach another
 * person's ledger than the workspace one can.
