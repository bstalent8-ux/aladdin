 * The workspace dashboard — one route, one shell, two seats.
 *
 * A Showroom asks "what am I buying and what is it costing me". A Distributor,
 * Manufacturer or Importer asks "what is being asked of me and am I converting
 * it". Those are different questions over the SAME records, so they get different
 * panels rather than one dashboard that tries to answer both and ranks neither.
 *
 * The choice is derived from `organizations.org_type` and nothing else. It is a
 * presentation default: it grants no authority (capabilities and RLS decide that,
 * inside each dashboard), and every module both seats can reach stays reachable
 * from either one. Neither branch is a fork of the other — they are siblings over
 * one shared set of components.
 *
 * `getPageContext()` is `cache()`d per render, so resolving it here and passing it
 * down costs one identity/context resolution for the whole page.
