/**
 * A professional's PUBLIC profile — the destination the technicians directory has
 * been pointing at since it shipped without one (audit finding 2.5).
 *
 * DELIBERATELY OUTSIDE `/home`. It is not a personal surface: it is reachable
 * signed out (the middleware's authenticated set covers `/b2b`, `/admin`, `/home`
 * and `/onboarding`, not this), it carries no workspace chrome, and the visitor is
 * usually somebody else — a showroom deciding who to bring to a site.
 *
 * NOT FOUND COVERS THREE CASES ON PURPOSE: no such profile, a profile that is not
 * listed, and one whose account is no longer active. `profile_public_directory`
 * returns nothing for all three, and this page must not let a visitor tell them
 * apart — distinguishing them would confirm the existence of a private profile to
 * anyone who could guess an id.
