/**
 * PHASE 1 PREVIEW — the redesigned craftsman/technician dashboard, on its own
 * route, disconnected from the real data layer.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS A SEPARATE ROUTE RATHER THAN CHANGES TO `/home`
 * The live craftsman dashboard (`/home` → `ProfessionalHome`, see
 * `src/features/home/professional-home.tsx`) reads five real Supabase-backed
 * queries (`listMyAssignments`, `listJobOpportunities`, `getPointsBalance`,
 * `loadMyReviewSummary`, `listMyNetworkOrganizations`) behind auth and
 * onboarding-state redirects. None of that is touched here — this file does
 * not import a single `server/queries/*` module, and `/home` keeps its exact
 * current behavior in both light and dark mode. This page exists purely to
 * reach a UI/UX direction the founder can review before any of it is wired
 * to real data (see the redesign task's own written scope).
 *
 * EVERYTHING RENDERED BELOW IS MOCK DATA — see `mock-data.ts` in the feature
 * folder. Phase 2 replaces that file's exports with the real query layer and
 * folds the approved composition back into `/home`; nothing here is meant to
 * ship as-is.
 *
 * Locale, theme, and sidebar-mode cookies are read (read-only) so the preview
 * opens with the visitor's own presentation preferences, exactly like every
 * other authenticated surface — this is presentation continuity, not a
 * dependency on product state.
