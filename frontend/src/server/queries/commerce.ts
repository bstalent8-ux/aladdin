 * WHAT THESE ARE NOT
 * There is no opportunity store, no matching engine, no lead score and no market
 * feed behind any of this. The reference's opportunity cards are populated by a
 * service that finds buyers hunting for your products across a marketplace; this
 * repository has no such service, and inventing one that returned plausible rows
 * would be the single most dishonest thing on the page. What IS real is that
 * buyers address requests to this organization and those requests name products
 * and quantities — so the block shows exactly that, and its wording says so.
 *
 * The movement window counts DISTINCT REQUESTS per product, never lines: a
 * request that itemises the same product twice (two finishes, two delivery
 * dates) is one business asking once, and counting it as two would tell a seller
 * their demand doubled when it did not.
