/**
 * Reads for Portfolio and Certificates.
 *
 * I/O ONLY — no rules live here. Every predicate that matters is already in the
 * database and cannot be skipped by a caller:
 *
 *   * `portfolio_items_select_own` and `certificates_select_own` restrict rows to
 *     their owner AND exclude `state = 'deleted'`, so a row awaiting object
 *     cleanup is invisible here without any query saying so. That is deliberate
 *     (§8): a cleanup state kept out of ordinary queries by POLICY cannot be
 *     resurfaced later by a hand-written select.
 *   * `public_portfolio_items` is the published projection — public AND ready AND
 *     on a currently listed profile — and carries no owner id, no storage key,
 *     no state and no visibility.
 *
 * So the only judgement in this file is which columns to ask for.
