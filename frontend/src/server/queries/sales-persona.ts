/**
 * "Is this account a SALESPERSON?" — the one frontend answer to the question the
 * Sales-affiliation flow asks, and a mirror of `app.is_sales_persona` in
 * `20260831090001_sales_affiliation_persona_hardening.sql`.
 *
 * The database is the authority: every affiliation write path refuses a non-Sales
 * persona with its own check, so nothing here grants anything. This exists so the
 * UI can say plainly *"this isn't for your account type"* instead of letting
 * someone fill in a form that the server was always going to reject.
 *
 * TWO SOURCES, and the second is required rather than generous. `users.primary_account_type`
 * is written only by the approved-and-applied upgrade workflow, so between
 * submitting a professional profile and an Admin applying it the canonical column
 * is still null — while the account is active and usable the whole time
 * (activation is not verification). `individual_onboarding.prof_concrete_type` is
 * what the person declared about themselves, and it is the same resolution
 * `loadPersonalHome` already uses to decide which home to render: *"the declared
 * type is what the account actually is, and the separate verification state says
 * how far the platform has gone in trusting the claim."*
 *
 * Reading only the canonical column would lock a genuine salesperson out of
 * connecting to their employer for the whole review window — a regression wearing
 * a security fix's clothes, and exactly what the database predicate avoids.
