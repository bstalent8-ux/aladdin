 * This reads the caller's OWN commerce records and groups them by counterparty:
 * "who works with me, and how much". Those are different questions, and the
 * second one cannot be answered from a directory at all.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT SAFE
 * Every row counted here is a record the caller is a PARTY TO — it sent the
 * quotation, it is fulfilling the order. The figures are therefore facts about
 * the caller's own business ("we have done 4 orders worth X with them"), not
 * disclosures about the customer's ("they spend Y in total"), and they would read
 * zero for any other viewer. Nothing private about the counterparty is exposed:
 * the only columns taken from the customer's side are its NAME, which is already
 * on every record the caller can open, and whatever the hardened public directory
 * chooses to publish.
 *
 * A customer that is not verified simply has no public row, so it keeps the name
 * from the commerce records and reports `listed: false`. It is deliberately NOT
 * dropped — a real trading relationship must not disappear from the seller's own
 * customer list because the other business has not finished verification.
 *
 * There is no invented CRM here: no contact person, no credit terms, no
 * segments, no scores. Every field is either a count of records or a published
 * public column.
