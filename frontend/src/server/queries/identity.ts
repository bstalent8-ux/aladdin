/**
 * The signed-in person, as the account CHROME needs to describe them.
 *
 * This is deliberately thin. The profile menu shows who you are signed in as —
 * a name and the contact that was verified — and nothing else. It is not a
 * profile loader, it does not read completeness, persona, verification state or
 * memberships, and it must not grow into one: those belong to the surfaces that
 * act on them, and pulling them into the header would put a multi-table read on
 * every authenticated page.
 *
 * WHY THE CONTACT IS EITHER/OR
 * Authentication is passwordless and a user verifies exactly ONE primary contact
 * at sign-up — WhatsApp OTP or email (see the canonical auth model). So a real
 * account may legitimately have no email at all, and a menu that renders an
 * "email" row unconditionally would show an empty line to every phone-verified
 * user. What is shown is whichever contact the account actually has.
 *
 * `cache()`d per render so a layout that also renders a header pays for one
 * identity read, not two.
