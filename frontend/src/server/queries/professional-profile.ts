/**
 * The professional profile, from the two sides it is read from.
 *
 * NO NEW STORAGE. The hub renders what `loadPersonalHome` already assembles; the
 * editor writes through `individual_save_professional`, which was built
 * re-entrant precisely so it could back something other than a wizard; and the
 * public page reads the hardened `profile_public_directory` projection. The one
 * schema change behind this module (`20260831090002`) created no table, column or
 * concept — it widened that projection over columns `individual_onboarding`
 * already held. What this module adds beyond it is the caller's OWN profile id
 * and whether the platform has listed it.
 *
 * WHAT IS PUBLIC. Identity (name, headline, summary, languages, persona), the
 * canonical trades `20260901090001` added (§4.6 — active keys only, primary
 * first), plus the four practice fields `20260831090002` added — specialization, core services,
 * years of experience, service areas — plus self-declared availability and the
 * timestamp of its last change (`20260831090004`, §8.4). The private side of
 * onboarding does not come with them: `prof_availability` (the one-off LEAD-TIME
 * preference, which is a different fact from the live flag), travel radius, base
 * address, the secondary service list and every consumer answer stay in
 * `individual_onboarding`, which remains readable only by its owner.
 *
 * THE PUBLICATION BOUNDARY IS THE WHOLE POINT. `public_profile_status` is written
 * only by `apply_account_upgrade`, so a professional cannot publish themselves,
 * and the projection additionally requires a canonical persona and an active user.
 * The hub therefore reports listing as a STATE, never as a switch — and the public
 * route 404s for an unlisted profile rather than rendering a private one behind an
 * unguessable id.
