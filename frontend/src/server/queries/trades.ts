/**
 * The canonical trade taxonomy, from the two sides the profile reads it.
 *
 * `loadTradeCatalog` is the VOCABULARY — every active trade, in the order the
 * table itself defines. `loadMyTrades` is the caller's own SELECTION. They are
 * separate because they answer different questions and have different lifetimes:
 * the vocabulary is reference data identical for every caller, the selection is
 * one person's statement about themselves.
 *
 * NEITHER TAKES A USER ID, and that is the point rather than an omission. The
 * only identity these can read is the session's own: `user_trades_select_self`
 * restricts the row to `auth.uid()`, so passing someone else's id here would
 * return nothing rather than their trades. Another person's trades are reached
 * through `profile_public_directory` — the approved public projection — and
 * nowhere else.
 *
 * TRADES GRANT NOTHING. Nothing in this module is consulted to decide what a
 * caller may do, and nothing should be: a declared trade is a discovery and
 * display signal, and an installer may take work outside it (O5). If a future
 * page ever gates on `primaryKey`, that is the bug, not this file.
