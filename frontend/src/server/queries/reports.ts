 *   - A buyer's RFQ tally answers "what have I asked for". A SELLER's answers
 *     "what has been asked OF me", and the status that matters is `submitted` —
 *     a request nobody has priced yet. That is the seller's one genuinely
 *     time-critical number and it has no counterpart on the buying side, where
 *     `submitted` merely means "sent, waiting".
 *   - A buyer's `topDistributors` ranks who it spends with. A seller's
 *     `topCustomers` ranks who spends with IT — same shape, opposite direction,
 *     and derived from the same single order read.
 *   - `topProducts` exists only here. A buyer's spend splits by CATEGORY (it
 *     buys across a sector); a seller's revenue splits by ITS OWN PRODUCTS, and
 *     "which of my lines actually sell" is the question the catalog module is
 *     downstream of.
 *
 * Reads: three list views plus, only when there are orders to explain, one pass
 * over their line items. Every one is RLS-scoped, so a caller sees exactly the
 * records it could open by hand.
