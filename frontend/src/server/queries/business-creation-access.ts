 * `submitBusiness`), so the rule cannot be bypassed by posting to the action
 * directly or by typing the URL.
 *
 * It reads only what the server already trusts: the caller's derived workspaces
 * (`my_workspaces()`), their own onboarding progress and open draft, and the one-open-application
 * verdict (`my_organization_application_slot()`). It adds an application-layer entitlement; the
 * database re-checks every rule on every write, so this never grants authority.
