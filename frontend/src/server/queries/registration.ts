 * The registration / access state, derived server-side (never client state) —
 * mirrors the `my_registration_state()` RPC exactly (Staging-prep Increment 7,
 * `supabase/migrations/20260924090007_registration_state_access_ready.sql`).
 *
 * `active_personal` keeps its ORIGINAL, narrower, tested meaning unchanged: a
 * real active organization membership, or `users.status = 'active'` via
 * `app.activate_personal_account()` (which never fires for the business
 * track). `access_ready` is a NEW, additive terminal state: authentication is
 * complete (confirmed email + consent + an approved top-level account type +
 * a valid stored username), independent of profile completeness or whether
 * an organization exists yet. Both states mean "may enter the app" — see
 * `hasAppAccess` below, which every gate should call instead of comparing to
 * `"active_personal"` directly.
 *
 * `username_pending` is a NEW, narrower state between `account_type_pending`
 * and `access_ready` — the RPC no longer returns `profile_pending`,
 * `contact_pending`, or any track-specific sub-state (consumer/persona/
 * organization-setup/invitation); that informational value now lives in the
 * non-gating `my_profile_completion()` RPC instead.
