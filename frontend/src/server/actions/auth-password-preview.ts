/**
 * Server actions for password-based registration/sign-in/recovery
 * (docs/frontend/auth-password-preview.md). Originally an isolated preview;
 * now PROMOTED to the canonical `/auth/*` routes (sign-up, sign-in,
 * forgot-password/*, finish-registration). The module keeps its historical
 * name; the old `/preview/auth-password/*` URLs are server-side redirects to
 * the canonical ones. The legacy passwordless actions in
 * `server/actions/auth.ts` still serve `/auth/verify` and `/auth/recovery`,
 * plus the shared `signOut` (see docs/frontend/auth-password-preview.md
 * §Legacy code audit). It deliberately reuses the
 * same primitives production auth already uses (`getServerSupabase`,
 * `sanitizeNext`, `resolveActiveLanding`, `my_registration_state`) rather than
 * inventing a parallel session/authorization model; only the credential
 * mechanism (password instead of a second OTP round-trip) is new.
 *
 * REGISTRATION ARCHITECTURE (revision 4 — promoted to Architecture B,
 * replacing revision 1-3's OTP-first Architecture A): `signUp({email,
 * password})` (`requestPasswordSignUp`) sets the password ATOMICALLY as part
 * of that one call, before any confirmation email is sent and before any
 * session exists (`enable_confirmations=true`, LOCAL ONLY — see
 * `supabase/config.toml`). The confirmation email carries a 6-digit
 * `{{.Token}}` (`[auth.email.template.confirmation]`, same code-based UX as
 * every other OTP in this app); `verifyPasswordSignUp` verifies it with
 * `verifyOtp({type:"signup"})` — the EmailOtpType the installed
 * `@supabase/auth-js` actually defines for this exact case, confirmed by
 * reading its shipped `.d.ts`, not assumed — and that call alone produces a
 * fully authenticated, fully password-usable session. The password is
 * therefore submitted exactly ONCE, to `signUp()`; the OTP step that follows
 * only ever handles the 6-digit code and NEVER re-collects, re-holds, or
 * re-submits the password (no hidden password field, no query/cookie/storage
 * persistence) — see `sign-up-form.tsx`. This has no equivalent of
 * Architecture A's interrupted "confirmed but no password" window, so the
 * `resumePasswordSignUpEmail`/`finishPasswordSignUp` resume machinery
 * revisions 1-3 needed for that gap is gone; `markPasswordAttachedAuthoritatively`
 * is still stamped after a successful verify, but now purely so
 * `migrationEligibility()` (the SEPARATE, unrelated existing-passwordless-user
 * migration flow below) correctly reports "already has a password" for an
 * account that registered through this path — see that function's doc
 * comment. Full investigation, the enumeration-normalization design
 * (`isAccountExistsError` below), and the `enable_confirmations` impact map
 * across every canonical call site: docs/frontend/auth-password-preview.md
 * §Registration architecture.
 *
 * Recovery follows the same OTP-native pattern: `resetPasswordForEmail`
 * sends a 6-digit code (not a magic link). REVISION 3: `verifyOtp({type:
 * "recovery"})` now runs on an ISOLATED, non-cookie-backed client
 * (`createIsolatedAuthClient`) — its resulting session is NEVER persisted
 * into the app's normal Supabase session cookies at all, closing the gap
 * revision 2 only partly closed (a plain marker cookie gated the UI, but a
 * fully-privileged session still existed in the real cookies the whole time).
 * The verified session's access AND refresh tokens are sealed into an
 * encrypted `pwr_grant` cookie (`lib/supabase/recovery-grant.ts`) instead —
 * both, because GoTrue SDK auth methods (`updateUser`, `signOut`) read the
 * CALLING CLIENT's own in-memory session via `setSession`/`_useSession`, not
 * a bare `Authorization` header. Screen 3's one `updateUser` call
 * authenticates by hydrating a FRESH, non-persisting isolated client with
 * `setSession({access_token, refresh_token})` from the grant (never the
 * cookie-backed client), then ends every session for that user on that same
 * hydrated client (global sign-out) and deletes the grant.
 * `features/auth-password-preview/recovery-session.ts`'s `amr` decoder
 * remains a documented negative result (GoTrue's `amr` does not distinguish
 * a recovery OTP from a normal one — empirically verified) — it was never a
 * viable gate, which is *why* isolation had to be architectural rather than
 * a check on the session.
