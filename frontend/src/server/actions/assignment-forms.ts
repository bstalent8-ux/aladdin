/**
 * Server Actions for the assignment lifecycle.
 *
 * FOUR ACTIONS, FOUR RPCs, AND ONE AUTHORITY BOUNDARY RUNNING THROUGH THEM.
 * `startWorkAction` and `addProgressAction` are the installer's;
 * `completeAssignmentAction` is the posting organization's and is imported by
 * the B2B job detail alone; `cancelAssignmentAction` is bound on BOTH surfaces
 * because `job_assignment_cancel` admits either party.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE DECIDES WHO MAY DO WHAT. Every refusal in this domain is raised
 * by the RPC, against `auth.uid()`, and would still be raised if this file
 * called all four actions from the wrong surface. What these functions own is
 * parsing a form, carrying the caller's JWT, turning a refusal into a sentence,
 * and revalidating the surfaces whose state actually moved.
 *
 * THERE IS NO COMPLETION ACTION FOR THE INSTALLER, and its absence is the
 * product rule made structural (§16): reporting 100 percent calls
 * `addProgressAction` like any other figure, and the assignment stays
 * `in_progress`. An installer-side "mark complete" would need a fifth function
 * in this file, and there is no RPC for it to call.
 *
 * NOTHING IS OPTIMISTIC. No action reports a new state before the database has
 * returned one, and the version each write carries is the one the caller last
 * read — a stale one comes back as `VC001` and is shown as a conflict, not
 * silently retried with a fresher number.
