/**
 * The server action behind both the onboarding wizard and the profile editor.
 *
 * It is deliberately THIN — a shape validator over a trusted security-definer
 * RPC — and this pins that it stays thin. The authority question ("is this a
 * professional identity?") belongs to `individual_save_professional`, which
 * answers it from `auth.uid()` (pgTAP 39). An authority check duplicated here
 * would be a second rule to keep in step, and the increment that shipped one —
 * the editor's track-derived `canSave` — locked out every seeded professional in
 * the Pilot until it was removed.
