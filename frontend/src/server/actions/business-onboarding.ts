/**
 * Business creation writers. Thin, shape-only validators over the trusted
 * security-definer RPCs — the verified-caller gate, the required-field check, the
 * transactional organization + owner-membership + primary-branch creation, and the
 * idempotency guarantee all live in the database (`business_draft_save` /
 * `business_draft_submit` → app.organization_create_owned).
 *
 * The DRAFT ID is the thread that makes this safe. It is the resume handle and the
 * idempotency key: submitting the same draft twice returns the same organization,
 * while a new draft is a new business. The client therefore always round-trips the
 * id it was given rather than relying on the business name, which is neither
 * unique nor stable.
 *
 * The same writers serve both entry points — registration and "add a business"
 * from an existing account — because there is one persistence model behind both.
