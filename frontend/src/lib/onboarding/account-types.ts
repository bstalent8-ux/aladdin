 *   PERSONAL  -> `users.primary_account_type` (a persona: who you are).

 * Choosing "Showroom / Dealer" therefore means "create a business whose

 * `users.primary_account_type = 'showroom_dealer'` — that conflation is exactly
 * the debt this sprint removes. A business choice records the type as INTENT on
 * `onboarding_progress` and carries it into the business draft; the person keeps
 * no personal persona unless they claim one.
 *
 * "Invited organization employee" is not a public choice — it is joined via an
 * invitation token, so it is modelled separately (`INVITED_EMPLOYEE`) and never
 * sent to the account-type RPC.
