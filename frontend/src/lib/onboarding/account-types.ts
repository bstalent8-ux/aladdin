/**
 * The canonical mapping of registration CHOICES to the database `account_type`
 * enum + `onboarding_track`. Shared by the server actions (validation) and the UI
 * (grouped cards) so the two can never drift.
 *
 * The choice is presented as a direct question — Personal or Business — and the
 * two groups mean structurally different things:
 *
 *   PERSONAL  -> `users.primary_account_type` (a persona: who you are).
 *   BUSINESS  -> `organizations.org_type` (a classification: what you are creating).
 *
 * Choosing "Showroom / Dealer" therefore means "create a business whose
 * organizations.org_type is showroom_dealer". It NEVER means
 * `users.primary_account_type = 'showroom_dealer'` — that conflation is exactly
 * the debt this sprint removes. A business choice records the type as INTENT on
 * `onboarding_progress` and carries it into the business draft; the person keeps
 * no personal persona unless they claim one.
 *
 * "Invited organization employee" is not a public choice — it is joined via an
 * invitation token, so it is modelled separately (`INVITED_EMPLOYEE`) and never
 * sent to the account-type RPC.
