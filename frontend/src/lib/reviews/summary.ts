 * no cache to go stale, and no window in which a suppressed review is counted in
 * one place and absent from the other. Both projections already exclude
 * suppressed reviews, so whatever reaches this function is exactly what a reader
 * can see.

 * Every consumer uses it — the Reviews page, the profile hub and the public
