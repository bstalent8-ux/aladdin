/**
 * Cookie-backed, CALLER-scoped server Supabase client (Server Components, Server
 * Actions, Route Handlers). The session lives in cookies managed by
 * `@supabase/ssr` and SHARED with the browser client, so it is deliberately NOT
 * HttpOnly — the browser client reads the same cookies to stay signed in. The
 * value is a Supabase-issued JWT (not a raw credential); every query runs under
 * the caller's `authenticated` identity and Postgres RLS enforces tenant/branch
 * isolation — never application filtering (ADR-0007/0008). The service-role key
 * is NEVER used here, and no access/refresh token is ever logged.
 *
 * ONE client per REQUEST (never module-scoped), so one request can never reuse
 * another request's session. `cache()` is what makes "per request" exact: React
 * scopes it to a single server render, so the layout and the page it wraps share
 * one client instead of building two that read the same cookies — which is also
 * what lets the context loaders below dedupe (they key on the client identity).
 * It is NOT a data cache and nothing survives the response.
 *
 * `setAll` is a no-op when called during a Server Component render (cookies are
 * read-only there); the middleware refreshes the session cookie on navigation and
 * propagates it on the response.
