/**
 * PERSONAL navigation — the sibling of `modules.ts`, and deliberately not an
 * extension of it.
 *
 * `modules.ts` answers a question this file cannot ask: *"which modules does this
 * membership's capability set unlock inside an organization?"* A personal account
 * has no membership and no capabilities, so every gate there is inapplicable here.
 * Reusing that model would have meant inventing pseudo-capabilities for a person,
 * which is precisely the conflation the account model exists to prevent — a person
 * is not a tiny organization.
 *
 * What replaces capabilities is the PERSONA, and only in the narrow sense of "does
 * this destination exist for this kind of account":
 *
 *   * every personal account has a home;
 *   * a professional has a professional profile; a consumer does not, because
 *     there is no professional profile to show — not because it is withheld;
 *   * a professional has Points, for the same reason they have a profile: the
 *     ledger is user-owned and the one approved earning rule credits a person,
 *     not an organization. It is deliberately NOT gated on holding a balance —
 *     a page that appears only once you have something is a page nobody can find
 *     the first time;
 *   * a salesperson has the showroom-affiliation route, which the database
 *     refuses to anyone else (`app.is_sales_persona`);
 *   * anyone may start a business, because owning one is a relationship, never an
 *     account type.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS AN AUTHORITY DECISION. Each destination re-checks its own
 * access server-side; this module decides only what to draw. A nav that shows a
 * link the page then refuses is a worse failure than one that omits it, which is
 * why `connectShowroom` takes the SAME resolved answer the page and the layout
 * use rather than re-deriving a persona test of its own.
 *
 * Pure module: no server imports, so the derivation is unit-testable.
