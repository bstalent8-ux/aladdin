/**
 * Capability-aware workspace navigation, organized into sections.
 *
 * Sprint 14 replaced a flat eleven-item list with five sections that follow the
 * shape of the work rather than the shape of the database:
 *
 *   Overview → Buying → Network → Selling → Business
 *
 * That ordering is buyer-first because the Showroom/Dealer was the account the
 * workspace was tuned for: a showroom spends its day requesting prices, comparing
 * incoming offers, and chasing deliveries.
 *
 * SUPPLY-SIDE SPRINT: THE SAME WORKSPACE, READ FROM THE OTHER SEAT
 * A Distributor, Manufacturer or Importer does the mirror-image work — it
 * RECEIVES requests, SENDS prices, and FULFILS orders — over the very same
 * records, because every RFQ, quotation and order names both parties. So the
 * supply side is not a second navigation, a second set of routes, or a second
 * application. It is this navigation with two things changed:
 *
 *   1. SECTION ORDER. The commerce trio leads under a "Supply" heading instead of
 *      trailing under "Buying", and the browse/shortlist pair demotes to a
 *      still-present "Buying" group (a distributor genuinely does buy raw
 *      materials — hiding that would be a lie about the business).
 *   2. LABELS. The same route is called "Purchase requests" from the buyer's seat
 *      and "Incoming demand" from the seller's. The href, the capability gate and
 *      the active rule are identical; only the word changes.
 *
 * Everything else — the rail, the collapse modes, the hover affordance, the mobile sheet,
 * the capability filter — is shared verbatim. There is deliberately no
 * `showroomNav` / `distributorNav` split to drift apart.
 *
 * Each module lists the capabilities that make it reachable (ANY-of). `org.manage`
 * is a blanket in-org unlock for ordinary modules. The narrow exact-gate set
 * below records the exceptions whose capabilities must remain withholdable.
 *
 * This is a pure, server-safe module: the AppShell computes the allowed keys from
 * the derived membership capabilities and passes them to the client nav.
