/**
 * Who may CREATE a business, who may CONNECT to one, and who merely WORKS in one —
 * three different questions the workspace chrome used to answer with one control.
 *
 * Pure module (no server imports) so the rule is unit-testable and every surface
 * that offers "add a business" asks the same function.
 *
 *   1. SWITCHING where you work is a matter of real memberships: anyone who
 *      genuinely belongs to an organization may move between them. It confers no
 *      authority — every request still re-checks membership, capability, branch
 *      scope and RLS.
 *   2. CREATING a business is an ENTITLEMENT of the account type. It is approved
 *      only for the five types below. Holding a membership never grants it: an
 *      employee or a salesperson can work in a showroom without being offered a
 *      second one of their own.
 *   3. CONNECTING to a showroom is the Salesperson's affiliation path (their Sales
 *      tools live in someone else's business). It is decided by the existing Sales
 *      authority (`loadIsSalesPersona`), not here.
 *
 * Presentation-layer policy only. It changes which entry points are OFFERED; it
 * does not touch RLS, membership authority, or the database enums.
