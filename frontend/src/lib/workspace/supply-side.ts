/**
 * COMMERCE STANCE — which end of the value chain an organization works from.
 *
 * The RFQ → quote → order chain has exactly two seats, and every commerce record
 * in the database already names both: `requester_org_id` and `supplier_org_id`.
 * The query layer has always been able to read a chain from either seat (`listRfqs`,
 * `listQuotations`, `listOrders` all take a side). What was missing was a derived
 * answer to "which seat does THIS workspace sit in by default" — so every surface
 * defaulted to the buyer's, which is right for a Showroom and wrong for a
 * Distributor.
 *
 * That default is what `commerceStance` supplies, and it is a PRESENTATION
 * DEFAULT ONLY:
 *
 *   - It never grants or withholds authority. Capabilities, membership, branch
 *     scope and RLS decide what a caller may do; this decides which of the two
 *     views they land on and what the module is called.
 *   - It never hides the other seat. A Distributor still buys raw materials and a
 *     Showroom still sells to its own customers, so both perspectives stay
 *     reachable on every commerce surface — the stance chooses which one LEADS.
 *   - It is derived from `organizations.org_type`, never stored, never mirrored
 *     onto the user, and never treated as a person's identity (see
 *     PRODUCT_DIRECTION_GUIDE: business classification belongs to the
 *     Organization).
 *
 * TERMINOLOGY WARNING
 * `supplier` here is the internal `org_type` identifier and the internal name of
 * the seller SEAT. It is never user-facing copy: English says "Distributor",
 * Arabic says "الموزع". Nothing in this module produces display text.
 *
 * Pure module — no server imports — so the rules are unit-testable and safe to
 * import from client components.
