/**
 * The professional-asset storage contract, as code both sides can hold.
 *
 * PURE ON PURPOSE — no `server-only`, no Supabase client, no `next/*`. Increment
 * 11's upload control is a client component: it has to tell someone their file
 * is 8 MB *before* a request goes anywhere, and it can only do that if the rules
 * are importable from the browser. `lib/nav` and `lib/work/assignment-state`
 * make the same split for the same reason.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS AUTHORITY. Every rule in this file is also enforced somewhere
 * a caller cannot skip:
 *
 *   * ownership and the key shape — `app.is_professional_asset_key`, in the
 *     `storage.objects` policies;
 *   * who may create at all — `app.can_create_professional_asset`, in the two
 *     INSERT policies;
 *   * content type and size — `allowed_mime_types` and `file_size_limit` on the
 *     bucket, enforced by the Storage service before Postgres is consulted.
 *
 * So this module exists to give a person a good answer quickly, not to decide
 * anything. A browser that skipped it entirely would be refused at the same three
 * places. See docs/database/professional-asset-storage.md.
