/**
 * THE DENSE WORKSPACE LAYER — the shared composition primitives every
 * supply-side surface is built from.
 *
 * WHY THESE EXIST
 * The seller workspace was functionally right and visually wrong: it read as a
 * single column of equally-weighted cards, so a Distributor's dashboard and a
 * Showroom's dashboard looked like the same page with different words on it. The
 * Distributor reference family is a different SHAPE — a banded page head, a tight
 * KPI strip that reads as one instrument rather than six loose tiles, a wide
 * working column with a narrow context column beside it, and a row of real next
 * steps at the foot. That shape is what these components encode.
 *
 * WHY THEY ARE SHARED AND NOT `supply/`
 * Distributor, Manufacturer and Importer are ONE workspace (see
 * lib/workspace/supply-side), so there is nothing here that a manufacturer gets
 * and an importer does not. And nothing here knows about a stance at all: these
 * are layout primitives, so a buyer-seat page that wants the same density gets it
 * by using them. What must never happen is three copies of this file.
 *
 * Every component is server-safe (no client hooks), so pages stay server
 * components and keep rendering their data without a round trip.

/**
 * The KPI strip — one instrument, not a row of loose cards.

 * HOW THE HAIRLINES WORK, AND WHY IT MATTERS

 * pixel past the container on those two sides so the outermost of those edges
 * slides under the container's own border instead of doubling it. That is what
 * makes the seams correct at ANY column count and at every breakpoint, with no
 * arithmetic: two columns on a phone, three on a tablet, five or six on a
 * desktop, and a part-filled last row that simply ends.
 *
 * The two obvious alternatives both fail here. `divide-x` places its rules by
 * child ORDER, so it draws them in the wrong places the moment a row wraps. And
 * a gap-over-a-tinted-background gives perfect hairlines but paints the empty
 * remainder of a part-filled row in the border colour — a grey block where a
 * sixth KPI is not. `border-e` is a logical property, so this mirrors in Arabic
 * for free, which a `border-l` version would not.
 *
 * WHAT A CELL MAY CONTAIN
 * A real count or total from the same query that fills the page, a unit, one
 * line of context, and — where and only where a real previous window exists — a
 * measured delta against it. See `KpiDelta` for the rule that keeps that honest.
 *
 * THE HEADER BAR
 * A strip whose figures are scoped to a PERIOD has to say so, and it has to say
 * so inside its own border. A period control floating above the strip, or
 * parked in the page head next to the module title, reads as scoping the whole
 * page — which it does not: the queues below are live work and are not, and must
 * not be, filtered by a date window. Putting the control in the strip's own
 * header binds it visually to exactly the numbers it governs.

 * WHY THIS AND NOT `WorkPane`
 * `WorkPane` is a wide working column with a permanently narrow context rail
 * beside it, and it is right for a MODULE page, where one list is the subject
 * and everything else annotates it. A dashboard is not that shape: it is a
 * sequence of rows in which the two or three blocks are peers of different
 * weight, and the reference builds every screen out of exactly those rows. Used
 * on a dashboard, `WorkPane` produced the failure this replaces — an 18rem rail
 * holding 300px of content beside an 800px column, so roughly a quarter of the
 * page width was blank from the rail's last panel down to the row's foot.
 *
 * `cols` describes PROPORTION, never pixels. A fixed `22rem` aside is dead space
 * at 2560px and a squeeze at 1280px; fractional tracks give the operational
 * block the extra room a wide display offers and hand it back on a laptop, which
 * is what "use the width, do not stretch the small cards" actually requires.
 *
 * Every variant collapses to one column below its own breakpoint, so nothing
 * here can produce horizontal overflow.
