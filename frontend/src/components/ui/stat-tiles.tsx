            Grid row (the row auto-stretches everything to the tallest

            SEPARATE grid instances (only the second one collapses), so

            ("طلبات قيد التنفيذ") read as its two lines running into each
            other — Arabic script needs more inter-line room than Latin at

 * `strip` is the dense presentation the supply-side reference is built around:

 * than as six unrelated cards, and it costs a third less vertical space, which
 * is the difference between the first list row being above or below the fold.
 *
 * `grid` is the older default and stays right for the three-or-four-tile strips
 * that open most modules — they fit, and a grid lets the eye compare them at a glance.
 *
 * `rail` is for the long strips (the dashboard's eight, Reports' six). Two things
 * make it the better answer there: the row stays one row instead of pushing the
 * real content below the fold, and a railed card does not SHRINK — which is what
 * used to truncate "EGP 1,103,100.00" when six money tiles shared a laptop width.
 * Where every tile fits, the rail renders no controls and is indistinguishable
 * from a row of cards.
