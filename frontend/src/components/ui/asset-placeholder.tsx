/**
 * An HONEST placeholder for a real photography asset this pass does not have
 * — never an invented substitute dressed up to look like content. Per the
 * approved Landing visual reference, several Hero/section zones need real
 * finishing-industry/showroom photography that does not exist anywhere in
 * this repository (confirmed by search). Rather than fabricate an abstract
 * stand-in for it again, this renders as a plainly-labelled placeholder in
 * the correct region, so the gap is visible and reportable instead of hidden.
 *
 * `label` names the requested asset (e.g. "HERO_VISUAL_ASSET_REQUIRED"); the
 * component is deliberately NOT styled to resemble a photo (no gradients
 * imitating marble/wood) — a diagonal hazard-stripe pattern is the one visual
 * convention actually meant to read as "placeholder", not "picture".
