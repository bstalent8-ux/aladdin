/**

 * "AH Design Studio" does not make the signed-in Engineer a showroom, and
 * selecting Personal does not drop their memberships. One person, one user id,
 * many places to work.
 *
 * What it lists is derived, never stored: the Personal entry appears only when a
 * personal persona was explicitly claimed, and each business entry is one ACTIVE
 * membership. A suspended or revoked membership therefore disappears on its own —
 * and selecting a workspace still grants nothing, because membership, capability,
 * branch scope and RLS are re-checked on every request.
 *
 * Layout is direction-agnostic (logical `start`/`end` utilities), so the panel and
 * its chevron sit correctly in both LTR and RTL without mirrored markup.
