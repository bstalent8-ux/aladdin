/**
 * PERSONAL navigation — the same navigation FAMILY as the workspace rail, a
 * different information architecture.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY IT HAD TO
 * The personal surface shipped a bespoke HORIZONTAL rail: a row of tabs under
 * the header, with its own hover, its own active underline and its own icon
 * geometry. The reasoning at the time was that four destinations do not earn a
 * 280px column. That reasoning is about INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE and it was
 * sound; the mistake was answering it with a different visual language rather
 * than a different list length. Route count does not authorize a new shell, and
 * an installer whose account looked like a different product from the showroom
 * they work with was the visible result.
 *
 * So the destinations are unchanged and the derivation is unchanged — only the
 * organ is. `personalNavKeys` still decides what exists; this draws it with
 * `NavLink`, the same row the workspace draws, inside `SidebarShell`, the same
 * panel the workspace stands in.
 *
 * NO DEAD LINKS. The list is exactly what `personalNavSections` derives from the
 * account, and nothing more. Jobs arrived in Increment 8, when `/home/jobs`
 * became a real route; My Work, Reviews and Network are still future Installer
 * destinations and slot into this same model when their routes exist — a nav
 * that advertises a route that 404s is worse than a short nav.
 *
 * SHORT LISTS DO NOT GET SECTION HEADINGS HERE. `personalNavSections` groups into
 * `account`, `work` and `business`, which the workspace would render as labelled
 * bands.
 * At three-to-five rows a heading costs more vertical space than the group it
 * introduces, so the grouping is carried by a rule between the bands — the same
 * device the collapsed workspace rail uses when its headings have no room.

       rail arranges them, because the carve has to reach past the column's
       padding to the panel's trailing edge.

       This was missing in the first cut of this component and the browser found
       it: `carved` is true from the shell, which tells `NavLink` to suppress its
       own 2px active marker BECAUSE a carve is drawing the active surface — and
       nothing was drawing one. The result was an active row with no background,
       no shadow and no marker, distinguishable only by a slightly brighter
       glyph. The tests could not see it (they assert the rows, and the rows were
       right) and the build could not see it. */

        /* THE SAME THREE THINGS THE WORKSPACE <nav> DECLARES, AND THE WIDTH IS
           THE ONE THAT MATTERS. The scrolling panel this sits in spans the whole
           sidebar INCLUDING the 14px gutter — deliberately, because a scroll
           container clips both axes and a scroller sized to the navy alone would
           cut the carve off at exactly the edge it exists to cross. So every nav
           inside it has to hold ITSELF to `--shell-nav-w`; the workspace rail
           does, and this one did not.

           Fourteen pixels of consequence, all of it visible at rail width: the
           row became 70px instead of 56, `navRowClass`'s `justify-center` centred
           the 36px tile in a 54px track instead of a 40px one, and the glyph
           landed 17px from the leading edge instead of 10. The carve is pinned at
           `NAV_COLUMN_START` — a DERIVED number, correct for a 56px rail — so it
           drew a 36px tile seven pixels behind the icon it was meant to be
           under: the offset blob. The rows also carried their hover surface and
           their focus ring out past the navy and onto the frame.

           None of that is a carve bug and none of it wanted a carve fix. One
           declaration, and every route on both surfaces gets the same row height,
           the same hit area and the same icon centre line by construction. */
