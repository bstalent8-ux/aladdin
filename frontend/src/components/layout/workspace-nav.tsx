 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO VISIBLE TOOLTIP ANY MORE
 * The collapsed rail used to grow a floating label beside whichever icon the
 * pointer touched. Two problems, and neither was cosmetic: the label appeared
 * OUTSIDE the rail, over page content, so a glance down the icons flickered a
 * box in and out over the workspace; and in "expand on hover" mode the rail was
 * already opening to show that exact word, so the tooltip raced the reveal and
 * the same label rendered twice in two places. What a user needs from a hover on
 * an icon rail is to know WHICH target they are on — that is a surface cue, not
 * a caption. So the hover now lights the icon's own tile.
 *
 * Nothing is lost for assistive technology: the localized label is still the
 * link's `aria-label` in the narrow state, so a screen reader announces exactly
 * what the expanded rail shows. The change is purely to what is PAINTED.
 *
 * Keyboard parity is deliberate — `focus-visible` gets the same lit tile plus a
 * focus ring, because a keyboard user moving down a rail of unlabelled icons has
 * strictly more need of "you are here" than a mouse user does.

                   CHILDREN. This used to fall through to the plain branch
                   below, which draws every key in `keys` as its own icon —
                   correct for quick access, wrong here: a "Network" group
                   the reader left CLOSED in expanded mode would still print
                   four separate icons the moment the sidebar collapsed,
                   exposing state the expanded rail had just hidden. Collapsed
                   and expanded now agree: a closed group is one thing in
                   both, drawn smaller in one of them.
                   The icon's own click TOGGLES its children open beneath it
                   rather than navigating — `href` still names the group's
                   first module (so the accessible name and keyboard Enter
                   both point somewhere real), but the pointer's click is
                   intercepted. It still carries the carve whenever the
                   reader is anywhere INSIDE the group, not only on the item
                   it links to, via `containsActive` rather than a route
                   match of its own — but ONLY WHILE CLOSED (`!revealed`).
                   Once the group is open, its real child is on screen and
                   carrying its OWN `active`, and the single shared carve can
                   only ever be on one element at a time — leaving the group
                   icon ALSO claiming `active` here would race it for the
                   carve (`querySelector` finds whichever is first in the DOM,
                   which is this icon, not the child underneath it) and the
                   highlight would sit on the wrong glyph. Closed, this is the
                   only cue there is; open, it steps back to the separate,
                   static `bg-shell-2` wash (`openIndicator`), which marks the
                   REVEAL state rather than the route — a group can be open
                   with no active route inside it, or active without being
                   open. */
