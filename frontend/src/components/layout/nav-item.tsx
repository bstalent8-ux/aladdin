/**
 * THE ALADDIN NAVIGATION ITEM — one row, one visual language, every surface.
 *
 * This is the family the UI contract means by "navigation modes may vary; the
 * navigation language may not". A B2B workspace lists twenty capability-gated
 * modules and a personal account lists three destinations; those are different
 * INFORMATION ARCHITECTURES, and they are allowed to differ. What is not allowed
 * to differ is what a navigation row looks like, how it lights under a pointer,
 * how it reports that it is the current route, and where its glyph sits.
 *
 * It used to live inside `workspace-nav.tsx`, which made it structurally B2B
 * property: the personal surface could not reuse it without importing the module
 * registry, so it grew a horizontal rail with its own hover, its own active
 * treatment and its own icon geometry instead. Moving the row here is what lets
 * `Sidebar` (modules) and `PersonalSidebar` (destinations) be two lists in one
 * language rather than two navigations.
 *
 * The row is deliberately DUMB. It takes a resolved item and a resolved `active`
 * and paints them. It performs no matching, reads no route table and grants
 * nothing — every destination re-checks access server-side.
