/**
 * THE SHARED AUTHENTICATED HEADER — now the TOP BAR of the whole shell.
 *
 * One header for every authenticated product surface — the B2B workspace, the
 * personal `/home` workspace, and the Admin console. Before this there were
 * three near-identical bars that had already drifted (different paddings,
 * different control order, three copies of the language/theme/sign-out trio),
 * and a fourth was one persona away.
 *
 * IT SPANS THE VIEWPORT, AND THE SIDEBAR STARTS UNDER IT
 * The header used to be a child of the content column, sitting BESIDE the
 * sidebar and starting at its inner edge. That made the sidebar the top-level
 * element of the page and the header a component of one region inside it, which
 * is backwards: the header is global chrome and the sidebar is navigation for
 * the region below it. It also meant the brand lived in the sidebar, so a
 * collapsed rail reduced the product's own mark to a 26px glyph, and the header
 * had a `brand` prop just to decide who was drawing it. Now the header is a
 * sibling ABOVE the row that holds sidebar + main, it always carries the mark,
 * and the sidebar sticks to `--app-header-h` instead of to the top of the page.
 *
 * It is NOT applied to sign-in, sign-up, OTP or the onboarding forms. Those are
 * pre-workspace surfaces: there is no workspace to search, often no profile yet,
 * and a command palette on a one-field OTP screen is noise. They keep their own
 * minimal chrome and the standalone language/theme switches.
 *
 * WHAT VARIES, AND HOW
 * Everything role- or surface-specific arrives as a SLOT rather than a prop the
 * header interprets. `context` carries the workspace/branch switchers (B2B), the
 * personal switcher (`/home`), or the Admin badge; `actions` carries whatever
 * live control that surface genuinely owns. The header itself has no idea which
 * persona is looking at it, which is exactly why there is no reason to clone it.
 *
 * DENSITY
 * One row (`--app-header-h`: 68px from `tablet`, 48 below) with 28px controls,
 * breadcrumb-style `/` separators between the mark and the context it names —
 * the direction set by the supplied Supabase reference. Every colour, radius and
 * focus ring is still an Aladdin token; what was borrowed is the COMPACTNESS and
 * the hierarchy, not a palette.
 *
 * The row grew from 48 for the BRAND and for nothing else — see
 * `--app-header-h`. Everything to the far side of it is unchanged and still
 * 28px: search, the workspace and branch switchers, the three panel triggers,
 * Help, the theme switch and the avatar all keep their boxes and simply centre
 * in a taller band. That is the whole point of the split — one element needed
 * room, so one element got it, and the header did not become a toolbar.
 *
 * WHAT IS WIRED, AND WHAT IS STILL A SHELL
 * NOTIFICATIONS and CHAT are both real: each reads its own table through the
 * caller's own client, so RLS decides what the panel may contain, and each
 * trigger carries a counted badge. The rule the shells were built under has not
 * been relaxed — a badge is allowed precisely BECAUSE somebody counted it.
 *
 * Feedback is still a SHELL. There is no feedback model — no table, no queries —
 * and it carries no count, because a number nobody computed is a lie in the
 * chrome. It still opens something finished and honest: the composer it will be,
 * with sending plainly marked as not open.
 *
 * RESPONSIVE
 * Below `tablet` the search field collapses to its icon and any `context` slot
 * moves to its own second row, so the top row never wraps on a 393px screen.
