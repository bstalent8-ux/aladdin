/**
 * CHAT AND NOTIFICATIONS — ONE SHELL, NOW FULLY FILLED.
 *
 * `HeaderMenu` owns the trigger, the panel, and every interaction that has
 * nothing to do with content: outside-click and Escape to close, focus handling,
 * `aria-haspopup`/`aria-expanded`, RTL anchoring, mobile width clamping. Chat and
 * Notifications are then just a title, an icon and a BODY.
 *
 * That prediction held twice. NOTIFICATIONS gained its table
 * (`docs/database/notifications-core.md`) and then CHAT gained its own
 * (`docs/database/chat-core.md`): both bodies are real lists backed by RLS-scoped
 * reads, both triggers carry a count somebody computed, and each change was
 * exactly the two things this note said it would be — a body swapped in behind
 * the same heading, and a badge passed in. No geometry moved either time.
 *
 * They are shared components, mounted once in the shared `AppHeader`, so every
 * authenticated surface gets the same two controls. There is no persona-specific
 * variant of either, and there must not be one.
 */
/**
 * One shell gutter. The panel stops this far short of either screen edge — the
 * same 0.75rem `menuSurfaceClass` already reserves for its width cap, so a
 * clamped panel lines up with every other floating surface instead of sitting a
 * few pixels off its own rule.
 */
const PANEL_GUTTER = 12;

/**
 * THE PANEL SURFACE, HELD INSIDE THE VIEWPORT.
 *
 * The panel is anchored to its TRIGGER (`end-0` on the 28px control), and that
 * is the right relationship: a panel that detaches from the control that opened
 * it reads as a different surface. But the trigger is not at the edge of the
 * screen — Notifications sits fifth in a cluster of seven, ~130px in from the
 * header's inline-end edge. A desktop header has room to spare for the 320px
 * panel to hang inward from there. At 393px it does not, so the panel ran off
 * the far edge and clipped the START of every row — which in Arabic is the first
 * word of every sentence.
 *
 * `menuSurfaceClass` caps the panel's WIDTH against the viewport, and that cap
 * is precisely why this survived the pass that introduced it: a max-width can
 * only rescue a surface that is too WIDE. This one is the approved width and in
 * the wrong PLACE, and no max-width moves a box.
 *
 * So the position is corrected after layout and before paint. Three properties
 * make this a small fix rather than a positioning system:
 *
 *   - It is PHYSICAL, so there is no direction branch. `getBoundingClientRect`
 *     and `translateX` are both left-to-right whatever `dir` says, so RTL and
 *     LTR overflow — exact mirror images — are corrected by the same subtraction.
 *     A logical fix would have needed two cases and could only ever be half
 *     tested.
 *   - It is a NO-OP where it is not needed. On a desktop header nothing falls
 *     outside the gutter, `dx` is 0, no transform is written, and the approved
 *     desktop geometry is not merely preserved but untouched.
 *   - It has no breakpoint. The panel is held inside whatever width it is opened
 *     at, so this cannot drift the next time the control cluster gains or loses
 *     an icon — which is the change that would silently re-break a `tablet:`
 *     override.
 *
 * Rendered only while open, which is what lets it use `useLayoutEffect` without
 * an isomorphic shim: `open` is false through SSR, so this component and its
 * measurement never run on the server.

 *     never a count of rows on screen;
 *   - zero conversations keeps the honest empty state below, unchanged;
 *   - no local storage, no polling, no realtime subscription.
 *
 * A thread opens INSIDE this panel — there is no `/chat` route in the approved
 * architecture, and inventing one is not this increment's decision. The panel's
 * geometry, anchoring, clamp and dismissal behaviour are untouched; only the
 * body behind the same heading changes.
 *
 * Badge reconciliation follows Notifications exactly: marking read fires the RPC
 * and then `router.refresh()` re-renders this route plus its layouts, while the
 * locally-cleared ids keep the count honest during the round trip. A stale id
