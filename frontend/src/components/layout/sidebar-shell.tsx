/**
 * The desktop/tablet workspace sidebar and its three display modes.
 *
 * ONE SIDEBAR. NOT A RAIL PLUS A PANEL.
 * Every mode is this same component at a different width, and — since this pass
 * — with the same active mechanic, the same ground, the same brand mark and the
 * same geometry. That sounds like a description rather than a decision, so here
 * is what it replaced: a collapsed rail whose active item was an accent tile
 * with a marker bar, an expanded panel whose active item was a carved band, and
 * a hover reveal that was a third thing again — a translucent accent wash on a
 * shadowed floating surface with a 40px strip of nothing travelling beside it.
 * Three designs sharing a list of hrefs. Collapsing the sidebar did not narrow
 * an object; it swapped one out.
 *
 * WHY TWO NESTED BOXES
 * The outer box is a SPACER: it is the flex child that reserves horizontal room
 * in the shell, and its width is the RESTING width of the chosen mode. The inner
 * panel is absolutely positioned and carries the VISUAL width. In expanded and
 * collapsed modes the two agree and nothing moves. In expand-on-hover they
 * deliberately disagree: the panel grows to 15rem while the spacer stays at
 * 3.5rem, so the reveal opens inward over the page instead of reflowing it.
 * Widening a flex child on hover would relayout the entire document on every
 * pointer pass — that is the "continuously resizing/shifting the body" the brief
 * rules out, and it is also where the flicker comes from.
 *
 * OPENING OVER THE PAGE IS NOT THE SAME AS BEING A SEPARATE PANEL, and the
 * difference is where the previous version went wrong. The depth cue used to be
 * a `shadow-lg` on THIS box — which is the shell plus its 40px gutter — so a
 * reveal painted a shadowed rectangle 40px wider than any material, and the
 * empty strip read as a second floating surface stuck to the sidebar's side.
 * The shadow belongs to the PLATE, which is the only part of this box that is
 * actually a surface. See the plate below.
 *
 * Because the panel is `start-0` inside the spacer, the overflow direction is
 * derived from writing direction for free: it grows rightward in English and
 * leftward in Arabic, in both cases inward toward the content.
 *
 * Mobile is untouched — this whole subtree is `tablet:` only, and `MobileNav`
 * still owns the phone experience.
 */
/**
 * THE SHELL'S LIVE DISPLAY STATE, published to whatever navigation it holds.
 *
 * WHY A CONTEXT AND NOT A RENDER PROP. The first version of this took
 * `nav: (state) => ReactNode`, which reads better and is wrong: `SidebarShell` is
 * a Client Component and the layouts that mount it are Server Components, so the
 * function had to cross the RSC boundary and React refused to serialize it —
 * "Functions cannot be passed directly to Client Components". It failed at
 * RUNTIME on both `/home` and `/b2b`, while `tsc` accepted it, `next build`
 * compiled it and all 33 shell tests passed, because a client-side test render
 * has no boundary to cross.
 *
 * A context moves the handoff to where both ends are already client code: the
 * layout passes a plain ELEMENT (serializable), and the navigation inside reads
 * the state it needs once it is mounted.
 *
 * `carved` is always true from the shell — every desktop mode carves — but it is
 * published rather than assumed so the mobile sheet, which has no carve, can
 * mount the same rows on a different ground.

  /* THE SIDEBAR PUSHES THE PAGE; IT DOES NOT FLOAT OVER IT.
     The earlier shell's spacer was a PLAIN, unanimated box: its width was the JS
     `resting` value, so it only changed on a mode switch, and a hover reveal
     (which changes `visual` without touching `resting`) left it untouched — the
     panel then overlaid the page rather than resizing it.

     The approved direction is the opposite: the sidebar widening IS the
     application's own width changing, not a drawer sliding over it. So the
     SPACER carries the same animated value the panel does — and it now carries
     the SAME VALUE OBJECT rather than a second animation given identical
     arguments, so the two cannot drift apart even in principle.

     The width the server renders is still the mode cookie's (read in
     `AppShell`), so first paint is correct before this spring ever runs. */
  /* ONE WRITER FOR `--shell-nav-w`, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE FIX.
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     The width used to have TWO owners. Every render passed the resolved string
     to React through `style={{ "--shell-nav-w": visual }}`, and the same string
     to Motion through `animate={{ "--shell-nav-w": visual }}`. Both then wrote
     the same custom property on the same element, and they write it on
     different schedules: React only touches the DOM when the string CHANGES
     between two renders, while Motion writes it every frame of a spring and
     stops wherever it was stopped.

     That is enough to desynchronise state from geometry, and it was observed
     doing exactly that: `data-sidebar-mode="expanded"`, `data-sidebar-open="true"`
     — so React had computed `visual` as the expanded width — while the property
     itself still read `3.5rem`, the rail. The reason neither owner corrected it
     is the same fact from both sides: an interrupted Motion animation leaves the
     property at an arbitrary value, and if `visual` is UNCHANGED across the next
     render (which it is on `hover` -> `expanded`, because `open` is true either
     way) React writes nothing and Motion re-targets nothing. Both writers
     believe the value is already correct; the DOM disagrees with both.

     So the property now has exactly one writer: this MotionValue. React never
     puts the raw string in `style` again — it passes the VALUE OBJECT, which
     Motion renders on the server from `.get()` (first paint stays correct, off
     the mode cookie) and owns exclusively on the client.

     The animation is driven from an effect keyed on the TARGET rather than from
     a render-time prop. That is what makes the transition authoritative: the
     effect re-runs only when the target genuinely changes, and when it does it
     animates from wherever the value actually IS to where the state says it
     should be. An interrupted animation cannot strand the property any more,
     because the next target change starts from the real current value, and an
     unchanged target leaves the in-flight animation alone to finish.

     Nothing about the motion itself moves: same spring, same widths, same

            THE CORNERS ARE SQUARE NOW. They carried `rounded-e-[2rem]`, on the
            reasoning that the reference's trailing edge is an organic curve and
            a large radius at head and foot is the honest part of that. It is
            not: a 32px radius at the FOOT lifts the shell off the bottom of the
            screen and puts a wedge of frame under it, so the panel reads as a
            tall floating card rather than as the room the page is standing in —
            and it produced exactly the closing edge across the bottom of the
            page that the body above has just stopped drawing. The reference's
            sidebar is full-bleed top to bottom; so is this. The trailing edge

            gap so it lands in the same corner the reference does. This ordering

             the browser's default — so on a tall navigation list it would
