/**
 * GLOBAL SEARCH — one field that answers both "take me somewhere" and
 * "find me this record".
 *
 * TWO FAMILIES, ONE BOX, AND THEY BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY ON PURPOSE
 *   NAVIGATION results are LOCAL. The caller's reachable modules are already
 *   known on the client (the same `allowedNavSections` the sidebar draws from),
 *   so typing "ord" lists Orders instantly with no round trip. A command palette
 *   that waits on a network call to offer its own menu feels broken.
 *
 *   RECORD results are SERVER-SIDE, capability-gated and RLS-scoped (see
 *   `server/actions/search`). They start only after {MIN_QUERY_LENGTH}
 *   characters and are debounced, because the alternative is nine parallel
 *   queries per keystroke.
 *
 * WHY THE CAPABILITY LIST IS SAFE TO HOLD ON THE CLIENT
 * It is the same list the sidebar already renders from, and it decides only
 * which DOORS are drawn. Every route re-checks authority server-side and every
 * record read re-checks RLS, so a tampered list buys a redirect, not data. The
 * one thing deliberately NOT trusted from here is platform staff: `canAdmin` is
 * resolved on the server and passed in.
 *
 * STALE-RESPONSE GUARD
 * Every search carries a monotonic request id and a slower earlier response can
 * never overwrite a newer one — otherwise a fast "ce" landing after a slow "c"
 * repaints the list with results for a query the user has already left behind.

      {/* THE HEADER TRIGGER, ON THE FIELD FAMILY RATHER THAN THE PROSE RAMP.
          Styled as a field because that is what it becomes; on narrow screens it
          collapses to the icon alone so the header still fits a 393px phone.

          Every colour here moved, and none of it moved for taste. The control
          used to take `text-fg-secondary` — #5c6066, a COOL grey — and paint it
          on a warm Quartz ground inside a warm near-white card. Nothing about
          that is wrong on a paragraph, and it is the entire appearance of a
          control whose visible content is one line of placeholder: the field
          read as a blue-grey component borrowed from a different design system,
          sitting in an Aladdin header. `field-*` is the same neutral ramp
          derived by mixing Ink into Quartz instead, so the ink keeps the
          ground's temperature. See tokens.css.

          THE FOCUS RING IS THE OTHER HALF. It was `ring-2 ring-focus` — a hard
          two-pixel band of #855a15 — which is a perfectly good affordance on a
          form page and far too loud for a control floating in the header card
          on every route. `field-focus` is Lumen at 38%: the same brand accent,
          spent as a soft halo, with the border stepping up to `accent` so the
          field's own edge carries the state rather than a ring drawn around it.
          `ring-offset` is gone with it — an offset ring needs a known ground to
          offset against, and this control sits on two different ones. */}
