/**
 * THE UI FOUNDATION GUARD — pure data and regexes only.
 *
 * Split out of `eslint.config.mjs` so this module can be imported with no side
 * effects: `eslint.config.mjs` itself imports `eslint-config-next` at module
 * load, which resolves Next's real ESLint config chain — fine for
 * ESLint's own process, but not something a Vitest run should trigger just to
 * exercise a regex. `src/lint/foundation-guard.test.ts` imports straight from
 * here.
 *
 * It locks in what is ALREADY TRUE rather than demanding a migration: a sweep of
 * `src/**` at the time this was written found zero raw hex values in component
 * code, zero arbitrary Tailwind colour values and zero escapes to Tailwind's
 * default palette. That discipline was holding by convention alone, which is
 * exactly the kind of thing that decays silently — one page in a hurry, and the
 * next author has a precedent.
 *
 * Four checks, all mechanical, all cheap:
 *
 *   1. No raw hex colour in component code. Colour belongs in `tokens.css`.
 *   2. No arbitrary Tailwind colour value — `bg-[#123456]`, `text-[rgb(...)]`.
 *      These bypass the token layer while looking like Tailwind.
 *   3. No Tailwind DEFAULT-palette colour — `bg-slate-500`, `text-blue-600`.
 *      These are the most dangerous of the three because they look canonical and
 *      are theme-blind: a `slate-500` is the same grey in light and dark, so it
 *      silently breaks one theme.
 *   4. No unknown SEMANTIC utility — see `UNKNOWN_SEMANTIC_UTILITY` below.
 *
 * WHAT THE ALLOW-LIST IS FOR. The foundation files themselves must be able to
 * write colour — that is their job — and generated types and brand artwork carry
 * literal values by nature. The list is deliberately short: if it grows, the
 * rule has stopped meaning anything.
 *
 * Everything here is a regex over source text. That is a real limitation and it
 * is the right trade: a proper AST rule for "is this string a Tailwind class"
 * needs a Tailwind resolver in the lint process, and a custom plugin is a
 * maintenance surface of its own. The regexes have false-negative risk (a class
 * built by string concatenation slips through) and near-zero false-positive
 * risk, which is the correct direction for a guard nobody should have to argue
 * with.

/**
 * THE FOURTH CHECK: an unknown SEMANTIC utility — a class that is syntactically
 * indistinguishable from a real token (no hex, no `[...]`, no default-palette
 * family) but names something that is not actually declared anywhere, so
 * Tailwind emits no rule for it at all and the element silently gets no
 * colour. This is the exact class of defect the Increment 11/12 sessions found
 * by hand — `bg-surface-sunken`, `text-warning-fg`/`bg-warning-fg`,
 * `border-line`, `text-heading` — each one a plausible-sounding name that
 * simply does not exist.
 *
 * THE ALLOW-LIST IS THE FLATTENED `colors` OBJECT FROM `tailwind.config.ts`
 * (plus `borderColor`/`ringColor`), transcribed by hand rather than imported:
 * `eslint.config.mjs` runs as plain Node ESM with no TypeScript loader, so it
 * cannot `import` a `.ts` config file the way the Next.js build can. This is
 * the SAME trade-off `TAILWIND_PALETTE` above already accepts (a hardcoded
 * list, not a live resolver) — extending the existing rule's own philosophy
 * rather than introducing a build-time Tailwind resolution step. A real new
 * token added to `tailwind.config.ts` needs one matching line added here,
 * which is a reviewable, occasional edit — nothing like the silent-typo
 * failure mode this check exists to catch.

 * lookahead only succeeds when the known alternative is the WHOLE suffix, not
 * a prefix of it, so `bg-surface-sunken` still matches (nothing in the list
 * is exactly "surface-sunken") while `bg-surface` and `bg-accent-solid` do
 * not (each is exactly a listed entry).
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NARROWER than `TAILWIND_PALETTE`'s prefix list: `shadow`,
 * `accent` and `caret` are left out. `shadow-*` is a different small
 * vocabulary (`sm`/`card`/`lg`/`glow`) this check does not yet cover, and
 * bare `accent-`/`caret-` name the NATIVE `accent-color`/`caret-color`
 * utilities (a different axis from this app's own `accent` colour token) —
 * both are a future narrow addition, not this one.
 *
 * `ring(?!-offset-)`: `ring-offset-canvas`/`ring-offset-surface` are the
 * OFFSET ring's own colour, a completely different Tailwind utility family
 * from `ring-<colour>` that merely happens to share the `ring-` substring —
 * without this exclusion every `focus-visible:ring-offset-canvas` in the
 * product (the single most common focus-ring pattern here) would false-flag.
 *
 * `[trblsexy]-\d+`: Tailwind's side-plus-width border compounds
 * (`border-b-0`, `border-t-2`, `border-s-2`, …) are a NUMBER appended to a

 * cannot express as entries. A second lookahead branch covers the whole
 * family without enumerating every side/width pair by hand.
 *
 * LEADING `(?:^|[\s:])` INSTEAD OF `\b`: a real utility class always starts
 * at the beginning of a class-list string, after a space, or after a variant
 * `:` — never after a comma or another letter. Plain `\b` also fired inside
 * two unrelated shapes that merely CONTAIN one of these prefix words: a CSS
 * property name inside a `transition-[...]` arbitrary value
 * (`transition-[border-color,box-shadow]` — "border-color" is a property
 * list, not a class) and ordinary English text in an unrelated string literal
 * (a test description reading "...remaining-to-next-level..." — "to-" is not
 * a class prefix there at all). Anchoring the prefix's leading edge to
 * start/space/colon excludes both without touching any real class, which is
 * always preceded by one of those three.
