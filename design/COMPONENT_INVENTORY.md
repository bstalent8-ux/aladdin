# Aladdin Component Inventory

The register of reusable UI components. **Search this file before creating any component** (see [new-component governance](./GOVERNANCE.md#new-component-governance)).

- **Version:** `1.0.0` · **Updated:** 2026-08-01
- **Status legend:** `Proposed` (named, not designed) · `Draft` (in `design.pen`, not implemented) · `Ready` (implemented + validated: themes, RTL, a11y, states, responsive) · `Deprecated` · `Superseded`.

## Current reality

**No product components are implemented yet.** `frontend/` has the scaffold home page only; there is no `frontend/src/components/ui/`. Every entry below is therefore `Proposed` — this inventory defines the *contract* each component must meet when built, not existing code. Do not read a row as "exists".

## Shared defaults (apply to every component unless a row overrides)

- **Supported themes:** Light + Dark (both first-class; parity required).
- **Supported directions:** LTR + RTL (one component, direction-aware; never a duplicate).
- **Supported platforms:** Web — responsive PWA (Mobile 390 / Tablet 768 / Desktop 1024 / Wide 1440).
- **Planned implementation path:** `frontend/src/components/ui/` (primitives) or `frontend/src/features/<domain>/components/` (domain), per `frontend/AGENTS.md`.
- **Design reference:** `UI-UX/design.pen` under QA authority board `00H`; the phone/OTP verification family is the approved premium reference. Confirm the specific component against `design.pen` before implementing — do not trust historical QA boards.
- **Accessibility baseline:** WCAG 2.2 AA — keyboard operable, visible focus (`--focus`), accessible name, non-color status, touch target ≥24px (≥44px touch).
- **Required states:** per the [component-state matrix](./GOVERNANCE.md#component-states).

## Signature brand components (custom, not library)

| Component | Purpose | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Aperture mark** | Logo/app-icon/favicon | Draft (approved geometry) | Geometry approved on the Brand Toolkit plate; runtime SVG export not yet produced (see [`icons/README.md`](./icons/README.md)). |
| **Verification seal** | Trust anchor (Verified Provider) | Proposed | Bronze concentric ring + monochrome Aperture + "Verified" pill (icon+text). |
| **OTP / verification field** | Passwordless code entry | Draft | Auth family is the approved reference in `design.pen`. No password fields anywhere. |

## Known system-wide gaps

- No component is implemented yet; all `Ready` criteria (keyboard, focus-trap, SR labels, touch targets, responsive) are **pending first implementation**.
- Icon library not yet installed (policy decided — see [`icons/README.md`](./icons/README.md)).
- PDF/document component fonts (Arabic shaping) unresolved — see `DESIGN.md` Typography.
