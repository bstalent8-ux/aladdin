# forwards the ORIGINAL request path — it does not strip the matched prefix —
# so the app genuinely receives `/api/backend/health` and its routes must be
# declared that way. (`root_path` is deliberately NOT used: that is for proxies
# that strip the prefix, which would leave these routes unreachable here.)

# bare paths (`/health`); nothing else in the codebase repeats this string.
