-- ===========================================================================
-- Verify the STAGING demo world. READ-ONLY: this script writes nothing.
--
-- ONE canonical file, TWO modes, no fork:
--
--   REHEARSAL / FIXTURE mode (strict — the default when nothing sets the mode)
--     Requires the database to hold EXACTLY the 27 demo accounts and nothing
--     else. Used by scripts/rehearse_staging_seed.py against a local/isolated
--     database that was just built from a clean seed load.
--
--   HOSTED mode (tolerant of unrelated non-demo registrations)
--     Requires the 27 expected demo identities to exist, by UUID, but does
--     NOT require them to be the only rows in auth.users — hosted staging may
--     carry accounts this manifest never created. Used against the hosted
--     Supabase project via scripts/verify_staging_seed.py.
--
-- This file intentionally contains NO psql meta-commands (`\set`, `\if`,
-- `\gset`, `\timing`) — it must run unmodified through BOTH a real `psql`
-- session (rehearsal) and Supabase's Management-API-backed
-- `supabase db query --linked --file` (hosted), which does not implement
-- meta-commands or `-v` variable substitution. The mode is instead read from
-- a plain Postgres GUC, `aladdin.verify_mode`, which the CALLER sets with one
-- prepended line of real SQL before this file's own content runs — see
-- scripts/verify_staging_seed.py (hosted) and the `psql(..., mode=...)`
-- helper in scripts/rehearse_staging_seed.py (rehearsal). If nothing set it,
-- this file defaults to the strict 'rehearsal' mode itself, so a direct,
-- unprefixed run stays safe rather than silently tolerant.
--
-- WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHY EACH ONE EARNS ITS PLACE
-- ------------------------------------------------
--   A. Population    — the 27 accounts exist. Exactly 27 total in rehearsal
--                       mode; at least those 27 (by UUID) in hosted mode.
--   B. Addresses     — unique, deliverable, and in lockstep with public.contacts,
--                      scoped to the 27 expected accounts either way. Sign-in
--                      is Email OTP only, so a duplicate or reserved address is
--                      an account nobody can open.
--   C. Linkage       — persona, membership, capability and branch rows all point
--                      at things that exist and belong together.
--   D. Consistency   — every quotation and order total equals the sum of its own
--                      lines, and every commerce record joins organizations that
--                      actually take part in it. A seeded total that disagrees
--                      with its items makes Reports contradict the detail screen.
--   G. Karim Adel    — named explicitly, not merely implied by F's non-emptiness
--                      check: sales.read, sales.write, a real branch grant, no
--                      org-wide capability, and non-empty branch-scoped CRM data.
--                      This is the specific account a pre-hosted-verification
--                      static-code read got wrong (see
--                      docs/operations/staging-demo-accounts.md).
--   E. Landing       — the route each account resolves to, computed the same way
--                      frontend/src/lib/workspace/model.ts computes it.
--   F. Non-emptiness — THE POINT OF THE FILE. Every account is impersonated under
--                      RLS and must have something to show. One account is
--                      exempt, by name and with a stated reason.
--
-- Deliberately keyed on UUIDs, never on email addresses: the addresses are
-- composed from a mailbox that must never enter the repository, so this file
-- checks their PROPERTIES and leaves their VALUES to the generated manifest.
-- Never prints credentials, tokens, or the identity of any row outside the 27
-- expected demo accounts — hosted mode's extra registrations are counted,
-- never named.
-- ===========================================================================

-- Wrapped in a transaction that always ROLLS BACK. The checks below only read,
-- but wrapping makes that structural rather than a promise: this script cannot
-- modify staging even if it is edited carelessly later. It also keeps the
-- temporary result tables alive for the report at the end.
begin;

-- Default to the strict mode if the caller set nothing, so a bare
-- `psql ... -f verify-staging-seed.sql` (no prelude) stays safe rather than
-- silently accepting unrelated rows.
