-- pgTAP: Installer Pilot Increment 4 — availability (D6/O3, §8).
--
-- Availability is the smallest piece of state in the Pilot and the easiest to get
-- subtly wrong, because three different mistakes all still "work":
--
--   1. Letting the CLIENT write `availability_updated_at`. Everything looks
--      correct — the flag flips, a timestamp appears — but the one signal a
--      poster has for judging staleness becomes the one thing most worth faking.
--      O3 keeps the timestamp precisely so a human can weigh the claim; a
--      forgeable freshness stamp is worse than none at all.
--   2. Letting a NON-PROFESSIONAL set it. Harmless today (the public directory
--      excludes consumers, so nothing would ever display it) and therefore
--      invisible until the column quietly acquires a second meaning later.
--   3. Treating it as an AUTHORIZATION BOUNDARY or a discovery filter. Nothing
--      may read this flag to decide what anyone can do or see. An unavailable
--      professional stays listed and stays findable — hiding them would be the
--      platform deciding that "not right now" means "not at all", the exact
--      inference O3 refuses to make on someone's behalf.
--
-- Every section below exists to pin one of those three down.
--
-- IT IS ALSO NOT `individual_onboarding.prof_availability`. That is a one-off
-- LEAD-TIME preference (`within_week`/`within_month`/`flexible`) chosen during
-- onboarding and still private. This is a live on/off state. A person can be
-- `flexible` and not currently available; both are kept, and §H asserts the
-- private one did not leak when the public one was published.
--
-- Fixtures, all from seed-pilot:
--   70000009 — canonical installer_technician, LISTED
--   71000006 — canonical installer_technician, LISTED → stays UNAVAILABLE here,
--                to prove availability does not gate discovery
--   70000005 — null canonical → given a DECLARED type here (the review window)
--   70000003 — made a consumer here
--   70000004 — made a personal account here
--   11111111 — business-only identity (null persona)
