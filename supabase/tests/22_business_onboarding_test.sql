-- pgTAP: business creation through the registration wrappers (Sprint 8, updated
-- for the Sprint 12 account/workspace model).
--
-- Proves the owner org-creation path is server-authoritative and caller-scoped:
-- business_submit enforces the required fields and then TRANSACTIONALLY creates the
-- organization (pending_verification, never self-verified) + the owner's ACTIVE
-- membership + the full owner capability grant + the primary branch, drives
-- my_registration_state() to active_personal, and emits the organization.created
-- audit. The internal org-creation helper is not callable by clients, direct table
-- writes are denied, and RLS is self-only.
--
-- Sprint 12 changes pinned here:
--   * the business-TRACK gate is gone. Any verified caller may create a business —
--     an existing Engineer adding one is on the professional track, and refusing
--     them would contradict "one person, many businesses".
--   * the owner/manager CONFIRMATION is gone. Creating a business is what makes
--     the creator its owner; there is nothing to confirm.
--   * both wrappers operate on the caller's open business_creation_drafts row, so
--     there is one persistence model behind every entry point.
