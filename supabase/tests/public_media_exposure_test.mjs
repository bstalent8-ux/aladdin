/**
 * Public portfolio media — the exposure and withdrawal probe.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR, and why it is separate from the storage harness.
 *
 * `professional_asset_storage_api_test.mjs` proves the boundary: who may write,
 * read and delete. This one asks a narrower and more paranoid question about the
 * ONE thing this product deliberately serves to strangers — a published
 * photograph — and it asks it from the outside, against the running app:
 *
 *   1. IS THE OBJECT KEY DERIVABLE from anything a visitor already has? Item ids
 *      are public by necessity: they are in the `<img src>`. If the key could be
 *      computed from one, every "the key is not disclosed" argument would be
 *      worthless. Section A measures that directly.
 *   2. WHERE DOES THE KEY ACTUALLY APPEAR? Section B greps the real surfaces —
 *      server-rendered HTML, the RSC flight payload, the media response's headers
 *      and bytes, the public API projection, and error bodies.
 *   3. WHAT CAN AN ANONYMOUS CALLER DO AT STORAGE? Section C probes listing and
 *      direct object reads rather than assuming the policy implies the answer.
 *   4. DOES WITHDRAWAL ACTUALLY WITHDRAW? Section D holds a known-good key and
 *      unpublishes, then delists, checking every path in between. This is the
 *      section the `no-store` change exists for.
 *
 * Needs BOTH a running local stack and the Next dev server on :3000, because
 * three of the four questions are about HTTP surfaces that do not exist in SQL.
 *
 *   node supabase/tests/public_media_exposure_test.mjs
 *
 * Everything it creates is torn down in a `finally`, and it fails if anything is
 * left behind.

   * WHAT ANON'S STORAGE ACCESS ACTUALLY IS, measured rather than assumed.
   *
   * This section has been wrong twice, and both corrections are why it drives the
   * real API instead of reasoning from the policy text.
   *
   * FIRST it asserted anon could reach nothing. False: a SELECT policy in
   * Supabase Storage is consulted by every read-shaped operation, so the policy
   * that let the media route mint one signed URL also permitted bucket listing,
   * a direct unsigned GET, and a HEAD revealing size and type.
   *
   * THEN it concluded that could not be narrowed, because "may sign" and "may
   * list" looked like one permission. Also false. Storage publishes the operation
   * being performed via `storage.operation()`, and a policy can require a
   * specific one. Driving each request shape through a temporary logging
   * predicate produced the exact strings:
   *
   *   sign -> storage.object.sign        list -> storage.object.list
   *   GET  -> storage.object.get_authenticated
   *   HEAD -> object.head_authenticated_info
   *   fetching a signed URL -> THE POLICY IS NOT EVALUATED AT ALL
   *
   * So the door is now one operation wide, and the assertions below are the
   * measured consequence: anon may mint a signed URL for a published object and
   * do NOTHING else at Storage.
