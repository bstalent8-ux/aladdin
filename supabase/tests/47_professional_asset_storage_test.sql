-- pgTAP: Installer Pilot Increment 10 — secure storage for professional assets.
--
-- This file and `professional_asset_storage_api_test.mjs` prove two halves of
-- one boundary and neither is sufficient alone:
--
--   * HERE — the policy expressions, the shape of the path contract, and the
--     things that are ABSENT on purpose. A test that runs inside the database
--     can assert "there is no UPDATE policy" and "anon appears in no policy at
--     all", which no amount of HTTP probing can establish: a request that fails
--     tells you it failed, not that nothing could ever make it succeed.
--   * THERE — `allowed_mime_types` and `file_size_limit`, which the Storage
--     service enforces from the bucket row before Postgres is consulted, so the
--     rows asserted in section A below are configuration this file can only read
--     back, never see applied.
--
-- WHY RLS IS THE WHOLE BOUNDARY. `anon` and `authenticated` hold full
-- INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE table grants on `storage.objects` — that is
-- Supabase's own default and this repository does not change it. So there is no
-- second line of defence behind a policy here, the way a narrow column grant
-- backs up `profiles_update_self`. Every policy added to this table IS the
-- permission, in full, which is why section D asserts the exact set and section
-- H asserts what stayed shut.
--
-- SUPERSEDED IN PART BY INCREMENT 11. Increment 10 gave BOTH buckets the same
-- owner-prefixed key contract, and `20260907090001_portfolio_and_certificates`
-- replaced the three PORTFOLIO policies with metadata-backed ones: a published
-- photo has to be resolvable for a signed-out visitor, and in this stack the Next
-- server shares the browser's anon identity, so an owner-prefixed key would have
-- published `users.id`. Portfolio keys are now opaque and ownership is read from
-- `public.portfolio_items`.
--
-- What that means for this file: everything below still governs CERTIFICATES,
-- unchanged, and the bucket / persona / absence assertions still govern both.
-- Portfolio storage authority is asserted in `48_portfolio_certificates_test`,
-- and section D below pins the exact boundary between the two.
--
-- Fixtures, all from seed-pilot:
--   70000009 — canonical installer_technician (the owner throughout)
--   71000006 — canonical installer_technician (the OTHER professional)
--   44444444 — end_consumer
--   11111111 — business-only identity: null personal persona, holds a membership

-- WHERE THE DELETE PROOF ACTUALLY LIVES, and why it is not here.
--
-- `storage.objects` carries a statement-level BEFORE DELETE trigger,
-- `storage.protect_delete()` via `protect_objects_delete`, that refuses EVERY direct SQL deletion with 42501
-- — superuser included — because a row removed in SQL would leave the bytes
-- orphaned in the backing store. So the DELETE policies below govern exactly one
-- path, the Storage API, and a pgTAP file cannot walk it.
--
-- This was worth discovering rather than assuming: an earlier draft of this
-- section "proved" that another professional's delete removed nothing, and it
-- was right by accident — nobody's delete removes anything through SQL. The real
-- assertions (owner deletes own, other professional refused with AccessDenied,
-- downgraded owner still deletes, second delete is idempotent) run against the
-- HTTP API in `professional_asset_storage_api_test.mjs`.
