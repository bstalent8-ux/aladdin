-- pgTAP: the Pilot Account & Workspace Model (Sprint 12).
--
-- ONE PERSON = ONE USER ID. This proves the eight acceptance properties of the
-- approved model:
--
--   A. one user may hold memberships in two organizations of DIFFERENT org types;
--   B. creating a business never writes its type as the creator's personal identity;
--   C. organization + owner membership + primary branch creation is transactional;
--   D. retrying the SAME creation draft yields exactly ONE organization;
--   E. two DIFFERENT drafts from the same user yield TWO organizations;
--   F. membership uniqueness and RLS isolation still hold;
--   G. a revoked/suspended membership cannot select or access that workspace;
--   H. migrated business-valued users retain their organization access.
