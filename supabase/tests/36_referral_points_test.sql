-- pgTAP: the ONE approved Points earning event —
-- referral.organization_approved = 100 (docs/database/points-core.md, D1).
--
-- Proves that the award is a side effect of the authoritative Admin approval
-- transition (public.showroom_referral_approve) and of nothing else:
--   • +100 exactly, to the salesperson named by the organization's WRITE-ONCE
--     provenance — never the approver, never the owner, never the organization
--   • the deterministic identity is ('organization', organizations.id), so a
--     retry and a concurrent-equivalent duplicate both fail to pay twice
--   • the LINKING path awards nothing: a business that already existed was not
--     brought to Aladdin by this referral, so it has no attributed recipient
--   • submission, rejection and every non-approved transition award nothing
--   • award and approval are one transaction — a failed approval leaves no entry
--   • the pre-existing approval, audit and membership behaviour is unchanged
--
-- Fixtures, all from seed-pilot (the same ones 28_persona_sales_affiliation
-- uses, so the two suites describe one world):
--   70000002 — a `sales` persona, our referring salesperson
--   70000007 — Laila, a second `sales` persona (referrer in the reject/link/coupling cases)
--   70000001 — owner of Cairo Ceramics Showroom (business-only identity)
--   55555555 — platform administrator (the approver)
--   9c00…001 — Cairo Ceramics Showroom, which ALREADY EXISTS (the linking case)
