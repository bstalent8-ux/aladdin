# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is right now

**Design-led, with the architecture foundation now scaffolded.** The primary design work product is the encrypted Pencil file `UI-UX/design.pen`. As of the repository-architecture-foundation task, the code foundation exists but **no product features are implemented yet**.

- `AGENTS.md` (root) is the **source of truth for coding conventions**, backed by a scoped hierarchy: `frontend/AGENTS.md`, `backend/AGENTS.md`, `supabase/AGENTS.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`, `data/AGENTS.md`, `UI-UX/AGENTS.md`. **Read the root `AGENTS.md` and every applicable scoped one before touching a file.**
- Architecture is fixed in ADRs under `docs/decisions/` (ADR-0001 approved architecture, ADR-0002 migrations, ADR-0003 agent-instruction hierarchy, ADR-0004 deployment, ADR-0005 Python data access). Product scope: `docs/product/mvp-scope.md`.

## Project Memory — Read First

Five files are **persistent project memory and part of the core architecture**, not optional docs. Product, architecture, UI, and unfinished-work decisions must **not** live only in prompts or chat history — they live here, and agents read them before making changes:

1. [`docs/product/PRODUCT_DIRECTION_GUIDE.md`](docs/product/PRODUCT_DIRECTION_GUIDE.md) — product direction & guardrails.
2. [`docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md) — currently active architecture (complements the ADRs).
3. [`UI-UX/UI_UX_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md`](UI-UX/UI_UX_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md) — design system, tokens, UX rules.
4. [`docs/operations/AGENT_WORK_LOG.md`](docs/operations/AGENT_WORK_LOG.md) — append-only session log & unfinished work.
5. [`docs/operations/RUNTIME_STATE.md`](docs/operations/RUNTIME_STATE.md) — current live repository state.

Full authority rules and the end-of-session checklist: root [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and [`docs/AGENTS.md`](docs/AGENTS.md). Documentation map: [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).
- `frontend/` is a Next.js App Router scaffold (typecheck/lint/tests green); `backend/` is a specialized FastAPI service scaffold; `supabase/` holds migrations (schema source of truth). Commands live in each service's README and `docs/guides/`.
- `docs/product/design-idea.md` is the original founder brief (Arabic). `UI-UX/design.*.BACKUP-*.pen` are frozen backups — **never delete or overwrite them.** All `.pen` files are gitignored and must never be edited by a coding task.

## The product: Aladdin

AI-first operating system / digital infrastructure for Egypt's finishing, construction, interior design, furnishing, supply, and professional-services sector. **B2B-first**, with a connected B2C consultation/discovery/project layer.

- Three surfaces: **B2C**, **B2B** (Sales is the key daily-active user), **Admin**.
- Core value chain: Need → Advice → Discovery → Trusted Match → RFQ → Quote → Decision → Execution → Follow-up. It is a **consultation-first** platform, **not** an add-to-cart / price-war marketplace.
- Multi-role taxonomy, **one canonical identity**: exactly NINE public accounts - Showroom, Supplier, Manufacturer, Importer, Contractor, Engineer, Craftsman, Sales Team, Personal - defined once in `frontend/src/lib/taxonomy/accounts.ts` and enforced by the database (see `docs/frontend/commerce-network-audit.md` Revision 6). Wholesaler is a Supplier subtype; Interior Designer, Trainer and Trainee are retired. Admin is a platform role, not a public account. Keep the nine separate even when behavior overlaps. A user has **one current primary account type** at a time; there is **no Profile Switcher / "Use As" mode / persona-switching UI**. Navigation and access are **derived** from primary account type, organization membership, branch assignment, permission capabilities, verification state, and subscription state. See [`docs/product/PRODUCT_DIRECTION_GUIDE.md`](docs/product/PRODUCT_DIRECTION_GUIDE.md).
- **Business classification belongs to the Organization:** Showroom/Dealer · Supplier · Manufacturer · Importer · contractor company (internal, behind Contractor) · design/engineering office are canonically **`organizations.org_type`**, never a person's long-term identity. **`users.primary_account_type` is personal persona state only** — one user may own organizations of several different types at once (*Ahmed*: persona Engineer · *AH Showroom* `showroom_dealer` · *AH Import* `importer`, same user ID), which one value cannot represent. Picking *"I am a Showroom"* at registration stays — it means *"I am creating a business whose `org_type` is X"*. Business-valued `primary_account_type` values are **transitional debt**, not the target source of truth; never mirror `org_type` into `users`.
- **Account / organization / workspace model (canonical):** **one person = one user ID** — another business never creates another user. Personal identity (`users`/`profiles`) is **not** a business, and a personal professional may hold **zero** organizations. A business is an **Organization**, created **once** in the UX (backend transactionally creates organization + owner membership + primary branch), linked by a **Membership** that owns relationship, capabilities, branch scope, and lifecycle; employees join by invitation. One login may hold **zero/one/many** organizations, and an existing user can add a business later with no second sign-up. **"Owner/manager" is a relationship, never an account/business type** (the generic entry is transitional back-compat only). A **workspace is derived** (Personal = User+Profile · Business = Organization+active Membership) — **no `workspaces` table**; switching the active **work context** is allowed and is *not* persona switching. Never duplicate business identity onto the user or personal identity into organization records.
- Egyptian context: real locality data (Cairo, New Cairo, Sheikh Zayed), EGP. English-first release, but components must support **Arabic RTL** from day one; Arabic version is part of the MVP. **Light + Dark** from the first design system.

### Authentication model (canonical)

**Email + Password** (canonical since 2026-09-28, PR #66):

- **General accounts** — Sign up at `/auth/sign-up`: Full Name + Email + Username + Account Type + Password, then **Email OTP** verification. Sign in at `/auth/sign-in`: Email + Password. Forgot Password at `/auth/forgot-password`: Email OTP recovery.
- **Installer/Technician exception** — `/installer/sign-up`: Full Name + Phone + Password (no email, OTP or username in that flow); `/installer/sign-in`: Phone + Password. Same canonical user/persona model (`installer_technician`). Installer Forgot Password is deferred. `/auth/sign-in` links to `/installer/sign-in`.
- **CAPTCHA** (ADR-0023, `docs/frontend/auth-captcha.md`) — Cloudflare Turnstile on Create Account, Resend, Sign In (email and phone), email code, Forgot Password, Change Password and phone sign-up; `interaction-only` where friction matters (Sign In, resends, Change Password). **Supabase Auth verifies** every token for the operations it processes (hosted CAPTCHA protection ON, Turnstile), which also covers direct `/auth/v1` calls; the app verifies with Siteverify (hostname + action) only the phone sign-up's Admin-API account creation. One verifier per token. Until the owner switches hosted CAPTCHA protection on, hosted projects only check token presence. Local `config.toml` keeps it off; the Auth CAPTCHA E2E workflow turns it on with test secrets.

One canonical identity regardless of sign-in method. Never surface technical implementation copy in the UI (no "WhatsApp Business API", "canonical account", server-side notes, etc.). *Superseded:* the earlier passwordless rule (WhatsApp/Email OTP only, "no passwords / no forgot or reset flows") — see the Change History in [`PRODUCT_DIRECTION_GUIDE.md`](docs/product/PRODUCT_DIRECTION_GUIDE.md).

### Design roadmap (order matters)

Build inner workflows **before** dashboards. Order: **05C** B2B Sales workflow (first — Sales is the daily driver) → **05A** Core B2C value journey → **05B** Quote & Project journey → **05D** Supplier/Showroom/Product ops → **05E** B2B Cockpit & Admin completion (dashboards last). Do not start a Session 05 module until the foundation baseline is reconciled and reviewed.

## Working with the Pencil design file

`UI-UX/design.pen` is **encrypted**. Access it **only** through the `mcp__pencil__*` MCP tools — **never** `Read`, `Grep`, or `cat` a `.pen` file.

- Before using any Pencil tool, call `get_app_state({ include_schema: true, include_canvas_design: true, include_scripts_and_shaders: false, include_browser: false })` — all four flags required — to load the current schema. You cannot use the other tools correctly without it.
- Node **names derive from the first ~22 chars of their content**, so name-search misses mid-string text. To search content, use `export_html` / `export_nodes` and grep the output.
- Canvas layout: top-level is a set of real container frames — `ROW 00 Foundation` (boards 00A–00H; **00H is the current QA authority**, overriding all historical QA boards), product `ROW 02`–`ROW 11`, then zones for Component Library, Documentation, Historical QA, and an Archive for legacy/superseded screens. Each product row uses lane order Desktop L/D · Tablet · Mobile L/D · Supporting States.
- Theme axis is **only `mode: light/dark`**. Platform / device / language are naming lanes, **not** theme axes.

### Pencil gotchas (learned the hard way)

- **Do not `Update()` layout props (`justifyContent`, `alignItems`) right after creating a frame** — it can corrupt that subtree's layout cache and render blank while the data reads correct. Build layout right in the first `Insert`. If a subtree renders blank, `Delete()` and rebuild it in one clean pass.
- **Persistence:** MCP edits land in the live editor's working copy; the on-disk `.pen` does **not** flush mid-session (mtime stays at session start) — it saves on the editor's own save trigger. Verify persistence by mtime/size.
- **Stale renders:** the screenshot tile-cache can show freshly built boards as blank for a canvas band until the file reloads. Trust an overlap/bounds scan (`Get(...)`) over a blank screenshot. `ctx.problems` flags only child-vs-parent clipping, not sibling overlap — compute sibling overlap yourself.
- Instance overrides use `descendants:{ childId: { prop } }`. `Replace(id, node)` swaps a node while keeping its layout slot. Warnings that name an already-replaced id are stale — verify by render.

### Trust rules

This file was built by a prior AI agent across sessions 01–04D, then taken over for context recovery. **Do not trust prior session summaries, QA boards, or "complete/ready" labels** — independently review each screen's full rendered UI. The consumer/business/admin home frames (Rows 09/10/11) are single rich frames, not stubs; much of the core value journey (05A–05E workflows) does not exist yet.

## Approved stack (see ADR-0001)

**Next.js App Router** + React + TypeScript strict + Tailwind (frontend, `pnpm`) · **Supabase** Postgres/Auth/Storage/RLS/Realtime/pgvector (schema via `supabase/migrations`, ADR-0002) · **specialized FastAPI** service for AI/OCR/RAG/documents/workers only — *not* the CRUD backend (`uv`) · OpenAI. Hosting: **Vercel Services** (web app **and** FastAPI, both declared in the repository-root `vercel.json`, one deployment; FastAPI same-origin at `/api/backend` but still server-side-only) + Supabase (ADR-0009, superseding ADR-0004 — **not Railway**). **Not Vite, not a React SPA.**

Config is centralized per service (`frontend/src/lib/env`, `backend/app/config.py`) — never read `process.env` / `os.getenv` directly in app code, and don't call `load_dotenv`. Fail fast on missing config; no silent defaults for secrets. Default to writing code yourself; justify every runtime dependency (see `AGENTS.md` "Dependency policy"). `pnpm` only for Node, `uv` only for Python.
