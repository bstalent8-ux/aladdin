| **Version** | Living (canonical) · rev 2026-08-12 |
| **Owner** | Product |
| **Last updated** | 2026-08-12 |
| **Scope** | The durable *why and where* of Aladdin — vision, positioning, priority rules, and the guardrails agents use to decide what to build and what to refuse. |
| **Authority** | Authoritative for **product direction**. Sits above [`mvp-scope.md`](./mvp-scope.md) (the *what and in what order*) and the [ADRs](../decisions/) (the *how*). Where this guide and `mvp-scope.md` disagree on sequencing, `mvp-scope.md` wins for the current cycle. |
| **Update triggers** | Any change to vision, positioning, target users, MVP boundaries, roadmap order, the account/identity model, or the "never do" guardrails. Every such change requires **explicit user approval** and a new [Change History](#change-history) entry. |

This is **core architecture**, not optional documentation. Product direction must never live only in a prompt or chat history — if a direction changes in conversation, record it here (and in an ADR when it is also architectural) before acting on it.

## Product Vision
An **AI-first operating system** for Egypt's finishing, construction, interior design, furnishing, supply, and professional-services sector — the trusted digital infrastructure that runs the whole value chain: **Need → Advice → Discovery → Trusted Match → RFQ → Quote → Decision → Execution → Follow-up.** B2B-first, with a connected B2C consultation layer.

## Product Mission
Make it fast and trustworthy to get the right advice, find the right verified provider/product, and execute a project — replacing WhatsApp threads, spreadsheets, and word-of-mouth with one intelligent, bilingual system.

## Product Positioning
- **Not** a marketplace with add-to-cart/checkout.
- **Not** a generic horizontal CRM.
- **Not** a price-war reverse-auction.
- **Is** a **vertical, AI-first operating system** for one sector in one market: consultation-first, trust-first, and bilingual (Arabic RTL / English LTR).

## B2B-First Strategy
Aladdin is built **B2B-first**. The organization is the tenant; **Sales is the highest-frequency daily-active user** and the product's center of gravity. The B2B operating workflow is what generates the structured data (needs, matches, quotes, pipeline) that every other surface depends on. We build the operator's workflow first and let the rest of the platform draft off the liquidity it creates.

## Connected B2C Consultation Layer
B2C is a **consultation/discovery** layer for end consumers — advice, discovery, and a path to trusted execution — connected to the same data and design system as B2B. It is not a separate product and not a storefront; it is the demand-and-discovery face of the same value chain.

## Three Product Surfaces
- **B2C** — discovery/consultation for end consumers.
- **B2B workspace** — where Sales (the key daily-active user) and organizations operate.
- **Admin** — control and governance (intentionally darker/utilitarian).

They are **skins of one design/data system**, not three products.

## Core Value Chain
**Need → Advice → Discovery → Trusted Match → RFQ → Quote → Decision → Execution → Follow-up.**

Every feature must locate itself somewhere on this chain and move the user to the next real step.

## Primary User & Daily-Active-User Priority
- **Sales** — the highest-frequency daily user; optimize relentlessly for their speed and low friction.
- **End Consumer** — seeking advice, discovery, and trusted execution.
- **Service providers** — Installer/Technician, Engineer, Interior Designer.
- **Businesses** (organizations, classified by `org_type`) — Showroom/Dealer, Supplier, Manufacturer, Importer, Wholesaler, Contractor company. The daily user is always a *person* acting through a membership in one of these.
- **Learning** — Trainer, Trainee.
- **Administrator** — governance and platform operations.

When priorities conflict, the daily-active Sales user's workflow leads.

## Sales Workflow as the Implementation Wedge
The **B2B Sales operating workflow is the wedge** (design roadmap 05C, first). Turning *Opportunity → Need → Match → Smart Share → Follow-up → Quote → Pipeline → Task* into a system:
1. creates immediate daily value for the user who shows up most, and
2. generates the **liquidity and structured data** that power discovery, matching, and AI for every other surface.

The CRM is not the whole product — it is the beachhead that makes the rest work.

## User & Account Taxonomy
One person can legitimately relate to the platform in several capacities (End Consumer, Installer/Technician, Engineer, Interior Designer, Showroom/Dealer, Supplier, Manufacturer, Importer, Wholesaler, Sales, Contractor, Trainer, Trainee, Administrator). **Roles stay separate** in the taxonomy even when their behavior overlaps — this keeps analysis, search, and permissions clean. Roles are merged later only by an explicit, recorded decision.

**Where each capacity lives is not uniform.** Personal personas (End Consumer, Installer/Technician, Engineer, Interior Designer, Sales, Contractor, Trainer, Trainee) describe **the person**. The business classifications in that list (Showroom/Dealer, Supplier, Manufacturer, Importer, Wholesaler, contractor company, design/engineering office) describe **a business the person owns or works in** — canonically `organizations.org_type`, never the person's long-term identity. See [Business Classification Belongs to the Organization](#business-classification-belongs-to-the-organization).

## Canonical Identity Model
- **One person = one user ID.** A human has exactly **one** authentication/user identity. Creating or joining another business **never** creates a second user for the same person.
- **One canonical identity per person**, regardless of sign-in method (Email + Password, or the installer Phone + Password exception). No duplicate accounts per role, per contact channel, or per business.
- **Email + Password is canonical** (since 2026-09-28, see Change History):
  - *General accounts* — sign up with Full Name + Email + Username + Account Type + Password, then Email OTP verification; sign in with Email + Password; Forgot Password via Email OTP recovery.
  - *Installer/Technician exception* — `/installer/sign-up`: Full Name + Phone + Password (no email, OTP or username in that flow); `/installer/sign-in`: Phone + Password; same canonical user/persona model; installer Forgot Password deferred.
  - *CAPTCHA* — Cloudflare Turnstile on Create Account, Resend, Sign In (email and phone), email code, Forgot Password, Change Password and phone sign-up; invisible unless Cloudflare needs interaction on Sign In, resends and Change Password. Supabase Auth verifies the tokens (also for direct API calls); the app verifies only the phone sign-up's account creation. In effect on a hosted project only once the owner switches its CAPTCHA protection on ([ADR-0023](../decisions/ADR-0023-supabase-auth-verifies-turnstile.md)).
- ~~**Passwordless.** No passwords, and no password/forgot/reset flows anywhere~~ — *superseded 2026-09-28.*
- A general account verifies its email at account creation; further contacts (e.g. phone) are added later from profile settings.
- **Organization membership, branch assignment, and permission capabilities are separate from identity** — they attach to the canonical account, they do not fork it.

## Personal Identity Is Not a Business
**Personal identity/profile data belongs to the user/profile domain** — End Consumer, Engineer, Interior Designer, Installer/Technician, Contractor, Salesperson. **A personal professional can exist with no organization at all;** an organization is never required for a usable account.

**A business is an Organization.** A Showroom/Dealer, Supplier, Manufacturer, Importer, Wholesaler, contractor company, or design/engineering office is represented internally as an **Organization** — never as a second user account.

The user must **not** experience this as *"create an account, then create an organization."* In the UX **they create their business once**; the backend may transactionally create the **organization + owner membership + primary branch** as one operation.

## Business Classification Belongs to the Organization
**Concrete business classifications are properties of the business, not of the person.** Showroom/Dealer · Supplier · Manufacturer · Importer · Wholesaler · Contractor company · Design/Engineering office — and every future business classification — are **canonically `organizations.org_type`**. They must **never** be treated as a person's long-term personal identity.

Why this is structural, not stylistic: **a user may own several businesses of different types at once.**

> *Ahmed Hassan* — personal persona: **Engineer** · *AH Showroom*: Owner, `org_type = showroom_dealer` · *AH Import*: Owner, `org_type = importer`. **Same user ID.**

A single `users.primary_account_type` cannot simultaneously be `showroom_dealer` **and** `importer`, so business type cannot be the canonical user identity in the target multi-organization model.

**`users.primary_account_type` represents personal identity / persona state** — it is not the type of every business the user owns or joins.

### Registration UX stays direct
The user may still pick *"I am a Showroom" · "I am a Supplier" · "I am an Importer"* directly — that is good UX and stays. Architecturally that selection means **"I am creating a business whose `org_type` is X"**, *not* "my personal identity becomes X". The backend creates, in one transactional and idempotent business-creation operation:

```
User (unchanged)
 └─ Organization(org_type = X)
     ├─ Owner Membership
     └─ Primary Branch
```

*When* that operation runs is the explicit *Add a business* step, never the registration submit itself — see *Registration account type: persona vs. intended business* below.

### Registration account type: persona vs. intended business (approved 2026-09-24)
The self-service registration choice is **not decorative**. What it means depends on which taxonomy it belongs to:

- **Personal persona choices (Tradespeople & Technicians, Sales Team)** become the account's **authoritative personal persona immediately after verified registration** — recorded server-side by `onboarding_select_account_type` as the *declared* persona (`individual_onboarding.prof_concrete_type`), the same value every professional authority already reads (`app.is_professional_persona`, `app.is_sales_persona`, the personal home). A new Tradesperson can open the professional profile editor and declare trades at once, with no six-step wizard. `users.primary_account_type` stays the **trust-reviewed canonical** persona written only by an Admin-applied upgrade (*Activation vs. Verification*).
- **Sales Team** gets the user-level Sales classification **only**: no organization, no membership, no Sales Rep / Sales Manager capability. Those stay membership-scoped and are reached through the affiliation request an Owner/Manager approves. The user-level Sales subtype (*Sales representative / Sales manager*) is a profile label, not a permission.
- **Business choices (Showroom, Supplier, Manufacturer, Importer)** record the **intended** `organizations.org_type` as registration *intent* only (it is never a personal persona: `users.primary_account_type` is not written). **Creating the FIRST business is mandatory (product decision, 2026-10-10 - it supersedes the earlier optional model).** After the OTP the account goes straight to business onboarding (`/onboarding/business`, the type preset and never asked again); submitting creates the organization with that exact `org_type`, makes the creator its owner through the existing membership authority, selects it as the active work context and lands in `/b2b`. There is no `/home` and no generic "no workspace" page in between: while the first business does not exist, `/home`, `/b2b` and the resume funnel (sign-in, `/onboarding`) route back to the business onboarding, and the draft resumes after closing the browser. The rule is derived on every request from the persisted registration intent plus memberships (`lib/onboarding/mandatory-business-setup.ts`, `server/queries/business-setup.ts`; routing needs no schema change). The registered type is also enforced at the database boundary while the first business is outstanding (`app.mandatory_registration_business_type`, used by `business_draft_save` / `business_draft_submit`; it is not a lock on later businesses); `my_registration_state()` still returns `access_ready` for this account by design. It applies only to a business registration with no personal persona and no organization that has never completed a business: an invited employee, anyone who also holds a persona (Engineer, Installer, Salesperson) and anyone adding a *second* business via `/business/new` are unchanged. Organization access still requires a real organization + membership + capabilities. Creating any business requires BOTH its business (display) name and its **legal / registered name** (`organizations.legal_name`, private, never in a public projection; historical organizations may have none), and the business location lives on its **primary branch** (`branches.governorate_key` / `city_key` / `city_custom_name`), not on the organization, because one organization can have branches in several governorates. The same legal-name rule applies wherever an organization is MATERIALISED: approving a Salesperson's or Installer's referral as a NEW business requires the Admin-verified legal name (linking to an existing business needs nothing). The place catalogue is the official CAPMAS 2023 units; see `docs/database/egypt-place-catalogue.md`.
- **Coming Soon** choices (Contractor, Engineer, Personal Account) remain visible and disabled; the server actions and the database account-type RPC both refuse a fresh selection (existing holders keep theirs).
- **Showroom subtype "موان" (signed off 2026-09-24):** internal key `building_and_finishing_supplies_retailer`; labels EN *Building & finishing supplies retailer* · AR *موان*. A Showroom-scoped retail concept — never the Supplier `distributor` key.
- A user's **own identity** (display name, photo, phone) is editable from the workspace-independent `/settings/profile`, which needs neither a personal workspace nor an organization — so an account with neither (for example, one whose only membership was revoked) is never stranded.

### The separation is enforced by the type system (Sprint 13)
The two taxonomies now live in **two disjoint database types**, so the rule above is no longer a convention that code must remember:

| | Type | Contains |
|---|---|---|
| A person | `public.persona_type` | `end_consumer` · `engineer` · `interior_designer` · `installer_technician` · `contractor` · `sales` · `trainer` · `trainee` |
| A business | `public.organization_type` | `showroom_dealer` · `supplier` · `manufacturer` · `importer` · `wholesaler` · `contractor_company` · `design_office` |

`users.primary_account_type` is a `persona_type` and `organizations.org_type` is an `organization_type`, so **`user.primary_account_type = 'supplier'` and `organizations.org_type = 'engineer'` are type errors** — in every code path, including a direct SQL statement by a superuser. The shared `account_type` enum is **dropped**; the transitional debt it represented is closed, not documented.

**Terminology — `supplier` is displayed as "Distributor".** The identifier and the label are deliberately different, so read every `supplier` in this guide as the internal name only:

| Internal identifier | User-facing English | User-facing Arabic |
|---|---|---|
| `supplier` | **Distributor** | **الموزع** |

The identifier is canonical in the database enum, code, and API and **is not renamed**; the display terms are what users read in both locales. Never surface `supplier` in the UI, and never introduce a `distributor` enum value or column.

Two nuances worth knowing:
- **A business whose classification shared a persona spelling kept its identity, under a business-shaped name.** A design studio typed `interior_designer` is now `design_office`; a contracting company typed `contractor` is now `contractor_company`. The owner of either may separately hold the matching *personal* persona — the two values now coexist honestly instead of colliding.
- **The registration CHOICE is the one place the taxonomies meet**, because the card the person taps either claims a persona or names a business to create. `onboarding_progress` therefore records it in two separate typed columns (`selected_persona`, `selected_org_type`), mutually exclusive and consistent with the track — never one union column.

## Membership Connects a User to an Organization
```
User  ↕  Membership  ↕  Organization
```
`Membership` is the link, and it owns the **organization relationship**, **role/capabilities**, **branch scope**, and **lifecycle/status**. **Employees join an existing business through an invitation** — they never create another organization in order to join one.

## Multiple Business Contexts Are Allowed
One user may have **zero, one, or many** organizations. Example — *Ahmed Hassan*: Personal → Engineer · *AH Design Studio* → Owner · *ABC Design* → Engineer/member. **Same login, same user ID**, three contexts.

## Workspace Is a UX Concept
- **Personal Workspace** = derived from **User + Profile**.
- **Business Workspace** = derived from **Organization + the user's active Membership**.

Both are **derived**. Do **not** introduce a generic `workspaces` table at this stage.

## Switching: What Is Forbidden, What Is Allowed
Workspace switching is **not** persona/profile switching.

- **NO** arbitrary switching between personal personas / account identities. There is no Profile Switcher and no "Use As" mode. A user has **one current primary account type** at a time, and it changes only through the approved, reviewed upgrade workflow.
- **YES** switching the **active work context** between the user's personal surface and the organizations where that same user holds an **active membership**. This changes *which context you are working in*, never *who you are*.

What the user can see and do inside any context stays **derived**, not toggled — from:
- primary account type,
- organization membership,
- branch assignment,
- permission capabilities,
- verification state,
- subscription state.

Keep roles separate in the taxonomy, and never imply simultaneous *profile* switching in product, navigation, or copy.

> **Implementation status:** the work-context switcher and the account lifecycle below are **approved direction, not built.** This section is the target model, not a claim that the UI exists.

## An Existing User Can Create a Business Later
Ahmed registers today as an Engineer. A year later the **same login** uses *Add / Create Business* → *AH Design Studio*, and the backend creates the Organization + Owner Membership **for the existing user**. **No new sign-up. No second auth identity. No duplicate personal profile.**

## Single Source of Truth — No Duplicated Identity
| Data | Canonical owner |
|---|---|
| Auth identity (email/phone credential) | the **auth user** |
| Personal identity / profile | **`users`/`profiles`** + the professional-profile domain |
| Business identity | **`organizations`** |
| Relationship, role, capabilities | **`memberships`** |
| Branches | **`branches`** |
| Business products, customers, RFQs, quotations, orders, projects | **organization-owned records** |

**Never** copy business identity onto the user as a second source of truth, and **never** copy personal identity into organization records as a second source of truth. Draft/onboarding rows may hold entered values **temporarily, as a draft only**; after commit every canonical read comes from the owning entity.

## Duplicate-Business Protection (for the upcoming implementation)
Business creation must be **transactional and idempotent**: retrying the same completed business-onboarding operation must return the **same organization** rather than create duplicates. **Business name alone is never the permanent unique identity;** future verified identifiers may include normalized legal/business identifiers where appropriate.

## Membership History
Leaving a company does **not** delete history. **Membership lifecycle is separate from user/account lifecycle** — a former/revoked membership must stop access while retaining historical attribution.

## Account Lifecycle — Approved Future Rule (do NOT implement now)
Recorded as approved direction only; **no deletion feature is in current scope.**
- **Deactivate** is reversible.
- A **delete request** starts a grace period.
- **Final deletion** removes/releases the login identity per the privacy policy; **business and audit history remains.**
- A later account using the same released email/phone gets a **NEW user ID** and **never** automatically inherits the old memberships, permissions, or history.
- Historical business actions may keep showing the person's historical name as **muted, non-clickable attribution** once the old account no longer exists.
- **Leaving an organization and deleting an Aladdin account are different events.**

## Activation vs. Verification (Pilot UAT round 1, 2026-08-11)
**Completing onboarding activates the account. Verification is an independent trust state and is never the activation mechanism.**

- Finishing consumer onboarding, and submitting a professional profile, make the personal account **usable immediately** — the user reaches their own `/home`. An Engineer, Interior Designer, Installer/Technician, Contractor, or organization-less Salesperson is never held in a review-waiting screen.
- Verification is reported alongside the account, never folded into it: *not verified · pending review · more info needed · verified · rejected*. It gates **trust and public discoverability**, not access.
- An Admin decision may add trust — the approved-and-applied review is still the only thing that writes `users.primary_account_type` and sets `profiles.public_profile_status = 'listed'` — but it must never be what lets someone in.
- **Profile completeness** is a separate, always-DERIVED signal computed from the applicable profile fields for that persona. It is never a stored percentage, never includes verification, and never blocks usage.
- **Locality is not a completion item — for now (product-owner decision, 2026-09-24).** No product UI or write path for a person's locality/city exists yet, so `my_profile_completion()` does not count it: counting it would make 100% unreachable for everyone. `profiles.locality_id` and the locality concept **stay in the domain unchanged**; locality becomes a completion item again in the same change that ships a real locality/city UX. Every item the checklist can show must have a reachable write path for that caller — completion is never faked for an unavailable field.

## The Salesperson Pilot Rule (Sprint 13, 2026-08-15)
**A Salesperson has a usable personal Aladdin account immediately. A showroom's Sales / B2B tools require an ACTIVE affiliation with that showroom.**

Five states, each moving on its own — never combined into one percentage or one badge:

| State | Example | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| Account status | `ACTIVE` | Whether the person can use Aladdin at all — yes, from onboarding onward |
| Profile completeness | `80%` | Nothing. A derived quality signal |
| Personal verification | `PENDING` | Trust and public discoverability, never access |
| Showroom affiliation | `PENDING` | Whether *that showroom's* Sales tools open |
| Showroom verification | `PENDING` | The showroom's own trust state, not the salesperson's |

A salesperson in exactly that combination uses their personal account normally and simply cannot yet open that showroom's B2B workspace. **Verification must never become the general account-activation gate again**, and landing is never derived from persona — "Salesperson → always `/b2b`" is wrong, because an independent salesperson may have no showroom at all.

Two paths reach an affiliation, and neither creates a second user:
- **The showroom is on Aladdin** → the salesperson finds it, requests to join, and an Owner/Manager of *that* organization decides, using the existing `org.members.manage` capability on the existing People surface. Approval activates a **Sales membership** through the same trusted path an invitation uses. A rejection never disables the personal account.
- **The showroom is not on Aladdin** → the salesperson **refers** it. This is emphatically not the owner "Add Business" flow: submitting creates no organization, and an Admin reviews the candidate through the existing verification architecture, preferring to **link** it to an organization that already exists over creating a duplicate. Company name stays non-unique — de-duplication is a reviewed decision, not a constraint.

**The referrer is never the Owner.** A referred showroom that nobody has claimed is created with a primary branch and the referring salesperson's Sales membership, and with **no owner membership at all** — the data model requires none, so a platform-managed, claimable business is available and fabricating an owner is unnecessary. Referral **attribution** is retained write-once (`organizations.source` + `organizations.referred_by_user_id`) so a future rewards feature can credit the salesperson; **no points, wallet, leaderboard or reward calculation exists.**

## "Owner / manager" is not an account type or a business type
It describes the **relationship between a user and a business**, so it carries no `account_type` and is never an `org_type`. Never create an `owner_manager` account type or organization type.

**Target registration UX:** *Choose what you are* → a **personal persona** **or** a **concrete business type** (e.g. Showroom/Dealer) → enter the business information → **the creator becomes Owner automatically.** If a manager-created-business path is supported, "Manager" is **relationship metadata inside business setup**, never a business/account type.

**Transitional (backward compatibility only):** the generic *"organization owner/manager"* registration entry — it carries a null concrete type, and the real organization type (Showroom/Dealer · Supplier · Manufacturer · Importer · Wholesaler) is chosen during business onboarding. It exists so already-saved and in-flight onboarding rows resume safely. It is **not** the target registration UX and must not be extended or treated as canonical.

## Consultation-First Principle
We **guide decisions; we are not a checkout.** The product optimizes for the *right, verified* match — trust over cheapest — never a race-to-the-bottom price war. Advice, verification, and provenance lead; pricing pressure never does.

## Marketplace & Commerce Anti-Patterns (never build)
- Add-to-cart, checkout, buy-now, storefront commerce.
- Price-war reverse-auction / blind price bidding.
- A generic, configurable horizontal CRM.
- Framing any flow as a transaction when it is a consultation.

## AI Principles
- **AI-first, tenant-scoped, human-reviewable.** Capabilities: intent extraction, consultation, matching + suggestion *explanation*, follow-up drafting, document retrieval/RAG, and AI evaluations.
- **AI is an operator's copilot, not an autonomous actor** — it drafts, explains, and ranks; humans decide and send.
- **Retrieval applies authorization filters before returning content** — no cross-organization leakage, ever.
- Automate **drudgery, not judgment** (OCR, embeddings, chunking, imports, document generation, operational delivery). Heavy/slow/external work runs off the request path with live status.

## Human-Review Requirements
AI **drafts and ranks; it never auto-sends** or takes irreversible action on a user's behalf silently. Smart Share and follow-up drafting are AI-assisted but always human-reviewed before send. Human-in-the-loop is a product requirement, not a "later" nicety.

## MVP Boundaries
See [`mvp-scope.md`](./mvp-scope.md) for the authoritative list and order. In short: authentication (Email + Password; installer Phone + Password), onboarding/profiles, roles, portfolio, catalog, smart search, AI assistant, notifications, subscription, advertisement, admin — plus the core value journey — built **Sales-first** (05C → 05A → 05B → 05D → 05E).

## Private-Pilot B2B Scope Boundaries (approved 2026-08-08 · reconciled 2026-08-17)

Product-Owner decisions taken on 2026-08-08 that are **still valid against the implemented product**. They were approved before the Sprint 9–14 B2B implementation landed; each one below was re-checked against current `main` and only the surviving decisions are recorded here.

- **The Pilot is free.** Eligible activated users use the service at no cost; **no online payment is collected and there is no checkout**. Packages may be described informationally. Upgrading extends the **same canonical identity**. See [`mvp-scope.md`](./mvp-scope.md).
- **Arabic is the default language**, English a first-class alternative with **exact information and action parity** — same data, same actions, correct RTL/LTR, no mixed-language UI beyond approved brand and technical terms.
- **Customer-need capture uses progressive disclosure** (surface not yet built): customer/opportunity, category, use case, and location first; quantity, budget, style, finish, and colour optional; required date/urgency, notes, and relevant attachments last. Never present the whole form at once.
- **Deferred B2B capabilities** — see *Deferred Scope* below.

**Superseded on reconciliation — deliberately NOT carried over.** The historical 2026-08-08 decisions were reconciled from commit `d7f947e`; the implemented product is authoritative, and the current canonical product decisions and supersession outcomes are recorded in this guide:

| 2026-08-08 decision | Superseded by |
|---|---|
| Opportunity pipeline `new → contacted → needs_captured → products_shared → quote_sent → won`/`lost` | The implemented **Lead** pipeline (`lead_stage`, `lead_status`, `transition_lead`) — [ADR-0008](../decisions/ADR-0008-b2b-sales-domain-model.md), [11](../technical/11_state_machines.md) §4a |
| "Quote Comparison is not MVP" | The implemented **buyer-first** quotations surface, which compares received offers before deciding (`frontend/src/app/b2b/quotations`) |
| Projects Lite statuses *Draft · Active · On Hold · Completed · Cancelled* | Implemented `project_status` (`planned`, `active`, `completed`) |
| Availability vocabulary *Available · Limited · Out of Stock · Coming Soon · Hidden* | Implemented catalog model (`product_status`: `draft`, `published`) |
| "Admin activates accounts manually" | **Activation vs. Verification** (2026-08-11) — completing onboarding activates the account; review is never the activation gate |
| B2B responsive contract (desktop sidebar · tablet rail/drawer · one-column mobile) | Already represented, in more depth, by [`UI_UX_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md`](../../UI-UX/UI_UX_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md) *Sidebar Behavior* + *Responsive Design Rules* (rev 2026-08-16) |
| Product-match / Smart-Share AI rules (human-reviewable explanation, price is not the primary rank, never invent availability, human sends) | Already represented by *AI Principles*, *Human-Review Requirements*, and *Consultation-First Principle* above |

## Deferred Scope (explicitly out of MVP)
- Payments, escrow, milestones, and disputes (designed later; **not** MVP).
- Advanced B2B administration: configurable permission engines, workflow automation, sales forecasting, competitor intelligence, and enterprise administration (approved 2026-08-08). Basic membership roles, operational analytics, and org/branch management stay in MVP.
- Marketplace checkout / add-to-cart commerce (never).
- A generic, configurable horizontal CRM (never).
- Price-war reverse-auction bidding (never).
- Building the entire platform at once — design broadly, build in phases.
- Speculative infrastructure (see ADR-0001 exclusions).

## Product Success Criteria
- A Sales user runs their real daily pipeline in Aladdin instead of WhatsApp/spreadsheets.
- A need becomes a trusted, verified match and a comparable quote without leaving the system.
- Cross-tenant isolation holds everywhere (UI, API, workers, AI retrieval) — zero cross-org leakage.
- Bilingual (AR-RTL / EN-LTR) and light/dark parity hold from day one.
- AI output is always attributable and human-reviewed before it acts.

## Product Roadmap

### Design roadmap (screen/workflow build order — order matters)
1. **05C** — B2B Sales Operating Workflow *(first — Sales is the daily driver)*
2. **05A** — Core B2C Value Journey
3. **05B** — Quote and Project Journey
4. **05D** — Supplier, Showroom, and Product Operations
5. **05E** — Cockpit and Admin Completion *(dashboards last)*

Build inner workflows **before** the dashboards that summarize them.

### Implementation roadmap (engineering build order)
1. **Architecture hardening** — the foundation is scaffolded; reconcile and validate before feature work.
2. **Identity and multi-tenancy** — canonical identity, Email + Password with Email OTP verification, tenant model.
3. **Organizations, memberships, branches, and permissions** — the derivation inputs for navigation and access.
4. **RLS and tenant-isolation tests** — the isolation spine, with tests, before feature data.
5. **B2B Sales implementation** — the 05C workflow on top of the hardened foundation.

The design roadmap orders *what the user sees*; the implementation roadmap orders *what must exist underneath it first*. Neither may be reordered without a [Change History](#change-history) entry.

### Long-term (Full Aladdin Platform)
Industrial/RFQ at scale, deeper supplier/technician matching (AI match scoring), organization↔organization project-execution workflow, learning & training, business opportunities, supply-chain workflow, and **payments/milestones/disputes**. The information architecture and design system are designed for the whole platform up front; screens are built in phases.

**Partially superseded 2026-08-31:** the *installation & service marketplace* and *person-level execution workflow* are now in Pilot scope **for `installer_technician` only**, as the Installer Jobs domain (organization posts → individual installer applies → assignment → progress → poster-confirmed completion → rating). It is a **new domain**, not an extension of the organization↔organization commerce spine, which is unchanged. See [`docs/database/installer-jobs.md`](../database/installer-jobs.md).

### Staging-to-launch completion order (approved 2026-09-07)

A **third roadmap axis** — the two above order *what screens get built* and *what must exist underneath them*; this one orders **the remaining gates between "the Pilot is built" and "the Pilot is launchable."** It starts where the design/implementation roadmaps currently leave off (PR #40, the Installer/Technician Pilot milestone, merged) and does not reorder either of them.

1. **Staging readiness** — hosted `aladdin-staging` at full migration parity, verified, healthy. (Phase 0 of this order — see [`RUNTIME_STATE.md`](../operations/RUNTIME_STATE.md) for the current status.)
2. **Non-admin account review**, beginning with **Hana Mansour** (the showroom-owner demo account) — not Platform Admin. Platform Admin is deliberately **last** in this order (item 10), so admin governance is reviewed against a fully-reviewed product, not the other way around.
3. **Cross-account end-to-end journeys** — flows that span more than one account (a Sales rep and a buyer on the same RFQ, a poster and an installer on the same job, and so on), reviewed after the individual accounts they compose are already sound.
4. **Landing Page and public surfaces.**
5. **Registration, onboarding, identity and authentication** (the flows as they exist today).
6. **Authentication and identity security** — a dedicated hardening pass, not part of item 5's functional review: password login's return, password reset/change, Email OTP, Phone/SMS OTP, WhatsApp OTP, a provider and per-message cost comparison, standards-based TOTP compatible with authenticator apps, recovery codes, a trusted-device policy, new-device verification, session duration/refresh policy, risk-based and periodic re-authentication, step-up authentication before permission/identity/payment or other sensitive changes, and an active-device/session list with remote revocation. None of this is built yet — this item records the **order** it will be tackled in, not a claim that any of it exists. Email + Password is now canonical (Change History 2026-09-28), so the "password login's return" part is done; this item still covers the hardening listed here. *(Superseded wording: it originally said this item did not reopen the canonical passwordless decision.)*
7. **Global UI/UX audit** — Arabic/English parity, RTL/LTR, Desktop/Tablet/Mobile as responsive presentation lanes (never separate products — see [`UI_UX_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md`](../../UI-UX/UI_UX_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md)), Light/Dark presentation lanes where supported, accessibility, performance, and the Loading/Empty/Error/Success state of every surface.
8. **Full application-security audit** — SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, IDOR, cross-tenant/cross-branch leakage, RLS bypass, privilege escalation, session/token leakage, brute-force and OTP abuse, account enumeration, password-reset attacks, upload and Storage security, API rate limiting, secrets handling, webhooks, audit logs, dependency risk, and security headers/CSP.
9. **Remaining product features** — including Full Chat/Realtime (the next Pilot milestone named in `RUNTIME_STATE.md`) and any other roadmap items reconciled by this point.
10. **Platform Admin, last** — expanded into a controlled **CMS / Platform Control Center**. See *Admin Control Requirements* below for how items feed it during the reviews above.
11. **Final release / security / UAT gate.**

This order is a sequencing decision, not a scope change: it does not add, remove, or redefine any feature, and every guardrail elsewhere in this guide (canonical identity, no persona switcher, the canonical authentication model, consultation-first, etc.) applies unchanged to every item in it.

#### Admin Control Requirements (backlog convention)

**Admin will be a controlled, permissioned CMS — never unrestricted SQL or code editing.** Every capability Admin eventually exposes is a **specific, scoped, audited action** (approve a verification, edit a specific field, toggle a specific flag), the same way `review_approve`/`membership_set_capabilities`/etc. already work — not a database console or a deploy pipeline.

During every account review, Landing Page review, Registration review, and feature review in items 2–9 above, **record anything that surfaces as "this should ultimately be manageable through Admin"** — a copy string that should be editable without a deploy, a threshold that should be configurable, a piece of content someone will need to update routinely. Log it (in the reviewing session's `AGENT_WORK_LOG.md` entry, or a dedicated backlog file if one exists by then) rather than building it inline or letting it evaporate. **This item does not authorize implementing the Admin CMS itself in any of items 1–9** — item 10 is where the backlog is triaged and built, deliberately after the surfaces it manages have already been reviewed.

## Product-Decision Process
1. A product-direction change is **proposed explicitly** and approved by the user — never changed silently by an agent.
2. It is recorded here (and in a new/updated ADR when it is also architectural).
3. A new [Change History](#change-history) entry is appended.
4. Affected specs (`mvp-scope.md`, feature specs) and `RUNTIME_STATE.md` are updated in the same session.

## Feature Priority Rules
1. **Sales-first** — the daily-active user's workflow leads.
2. **Inner workflows before dashboards** — build the thing before the summary of the thing.
3. **Approved spec before build** — no product tables/features without a written spec + ADR where architectural.
4. **Value-chain order** — respect the roadmap sequence; don't start a module before its prerequisites exist.
5. **Trust and isolation are never traded for speed** — RLS/tenant isolation and human-in-the-loop AI are not "later."
6. When unsure, **ship the smallest slice that delivers the next real action** in the value chain.

## What Agents Must NEVER Do
- **Never** build commerce/marketplace framing (add-to-cart, checkout, price-war bidding) — this is consultation-first.
- **Never** add a sign-up, sign-in or recovery path outside the canonical model: Email + Password with Email OTP verification and Email OTP recovery for general accounts; Phone + Password at `/installer/sign-up` / `/installer/sign-in` for installers/technicians (Change History 2026-09-28). *(Superseded 2026-09-28: the earlier rule "never add password/forgot/reset UI or flows — the product is passwordless".)*
- **Never** merge roles, and **never** add a Profile Switcher / "Use As" mode or any persona/account-identity-switching UI — roles stay separate in the taxonomy; navigation is **derived**, not toggled. One current primary account type at a time. *(Switching the active **work context** between the personal surface and organizations where the user has an active membership is a different, allowed concept — see [Switching](#switching-what-is-forbidden-what-is-allowed).)*
- **Never** create a second user/auth identity for the same person — not for another role, another contact channel, or another business. A business is an **Organization**, never a second account.
- **Never** copy business identity onto the user, or personal identity into organization records, as a second source of truth; after a draft is committed, read from the owning entity.
- **Never** treat a business classification (Showroom/Dealer, Supplier, Manufacturer, Importer, Wholesaler, …) as the person's canonical identity, and never mirror `organizations.org_type` permanently into `users.primary_account_type` — one user may own several businesses of different types at once.
- **Never** introduce a generic `workspaces` table — a workspace is derived (User+Profile, or Organization+active Membership).
- **Never** leak data across organizations in UI, API, workers, or AI retrieval; **never** bypass RLS or trust client-supplied `user_id`/`organization_id`.
- **Never** put technical/implementation copy in the UI ("WhatsApp Business API", "reCAPTCHA verified", "canonical account", stack/schema jargon).
- **Never** let AI auto-send or take irreversible action without human review.
- **Never** edit, rename, duplicate, or delete `.pen` files, and never create another canonical design file.
- **Never** build product features, tables, or connect production services during a foundation/spec-less task.
- **Never** introduce Alembic, `Base.metadata.create_all()` in staging/prod, a Vite/SPA frontend, or excluded infrastructure (ADR-0001/0002).
- **Never** invent an "approved" brand (final logo/font/color) before sign-off, or hardcode raw values instead of tokens.
- **Never** change product direction silently, and **never** claim unfinished work is complete.

## Change History
Newest first. Every product-direction change gets an entry: date, what changed, why, and who approved it.

### 2026-10-26 — Sign-in CAPTCHA is verified by Supabase Auth, Sign In included
- **What:** Turnstile runs on Sign In too (email and phone, invisible unless Cloudflare needs interaction), as well as Create Account, Resend, email code, Forgot Password, Change Password and phone sign-up. Supabase Auth verifies every token it receives, which also blocks direct API calls; the app keeps its own Cloudflare check only for the phone sign-up's account creation. Supersedes "Sign In has no CAPTCHA" and "Supabase global CAPTCHA off" (2026-09-24 / 2026-09-28 entries).
- **Why:** The audit found every token except the phone sign-up's was only checked for presence, live site included, and anyone holding the public key could call Supabase Auth directly.
- **Approved by:** the owner, 2026-10-26 (Option 2, then Option B). The hosted switch is a separate owner step per project ([ADR-0023](../decisions/ADR-0023-supabase-auth-verifies-turnstile.md)).

### 2026-09-28 — Email + Password becomes the canonical authentication model
- **What:** General accounts sign up at `/auth/sign-up` with Full Name + Email + Username + Account Type + Password and verify the email with a one-time code (Email OTP); they sign in at `/auth/sign-in` with Email + Password; Forgot Password (`/auth/forgot-password`) recovers access through an Email OTP. Installers/technicians keep the permanent exception: `/installer/sign-up` (Full Name + Phone + Password; no email, OTP or username) and `/installer/sign-in` (Phone + Password), with the same canonical user/persona model; `/auth/sign-in` links to it. Installer Forgot Password stays deferred. Supabase's global CAPTCHA stays off; application-scoped Turnstile covers Create Account, Resend Signup and the Forgot Password request; Sign In has no CAPTCHA.
- **Supersedes:** the passwordless rule (WhatsApp/Email OTP only; no passwords; no forgot/reset flows) in this guide, `CLAUDE.md`, `PRODUCT.md` and `ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`. Earlier entries below are kept as history.
- **Implementation:** PR #66 (`feature/canonical-password-auth`); feature doc [`../frontend/auth-password-preview.md`](../frontend/auth-password-preview.md).
- **Approved by:** product owner, 2026-09-28.

### 2026-09-27 — Installer phone + password entry point made permanent
- **What:** The phone + password flow approved earlier the same day as a temporary exception is now the **permanent, role-specific authentication entry point for installer/technician accounts**: `/installer/sign-up` and `/installer/sign-in` (the old `/temporary/craftsman/*` URLs redirect there). The homepage's installer tile/role CTA links to it, and the shared `/auth/sign-in` carries a small secondary link for installers. Forgot-password stays hidden until phone OTP recovery (SMS/WhatsApp → verification → new password) exists.
- **Unchanged** *(superseded 2026-09-28 — `/auth/*` is now Email + Password)*: the global authentication strategy. `/auth/sign-up` and `/auth/sign-in` keep serving the email/passwordless flow for every account type — including installers who registered by email, who keep using it (no account merging or identity linking). Showroom/Supplier/Manufacturer/Importer/Sales/Admin registration is untouched.
- **Details:** [`../frontend/installer-phone-auth.md`](../frontend/installer-phone-auth.md).
- **Approved by:** User (installer route promotion task, 2026-09-27).

### 2026-09-27 — Temporary craftsman phone + password entry point (scoped exception)
- **What:** A TEMPORARY, parallel registration/sign-in entry point for installer/technician (الصنايعي) accounts at `/installer/sign-up` and `/installer/sign-in`: full name + phone + password (+ consent + Turnstile), **no OTP**. Accounts are ordinary `professional / installer_technician` accounts on the one canonical identity model (same user ID model, same RPCs, same `/home` experience). The phone is canonicalized to E.164 and the account signs in with an internal, never-displayed login alias derived from it. Duplicate phones are disclosed ("يوجد حساب مسجل بالفعل بهذا الرقم"). Forgot password is hidden for these accounts.
- **Why:** Craftsman registration through the canonical email-OTP flow is blocked for this audience; this unblocks it without changing the canonical flow.
- **Scope** *(superseded 2026-09-28 — passwordless is no longer canonical)*: The canonical passwordless model, `/auth/*`, email-OTP behavior, other account types and the hosted phone provider are **unchanged**. The "passwordless" guardrail stands for everything else. Implementation and limitations: [`../frontend/installer-phone-auth.md`](../frontend/installer-phone-auth.md).
- **Deferred:** removal of the temporary flow and migration of its accounts to a verified phone (WhatsApp OTP) or email identity; a recovery path for these accounts.
- **Approved by:** User (temporary craftsman auth task, Option B, 2026-09-27).

### 2026-09-07 — Staging-to-launch completion order recorded; Admin Control Requirements backlog established
- **What:** Added the *Staging-to-launch completion order* — an 11-item sequencing decision covering everything from staging readiness through the final release/security/UAT gate, starting from the current state (PR #40 Installer/Technician Pilot merged, hosted staging reconciled to full migration parity). Order: staging readiness → non-admin account review (starting with Hana Mansour, not Platform Admin) → cross-account journeys → Landing Page/public surfaces → registration/onboarding/identity/auth → a dedicated authentication-and-identity-security hardening pass (password-login return, OTP channels incl. provider/cost comparison, TOTP, recovery codes, trusted-device/session policy, step-up auth) → a global UI/UX audit → a full application-security audit → remaining product features (incl. Full Chat) → Platform Admin last (expanded into a controlled CMS) → the final release gate. Also established the **Admin Control Requirements** backlog convention: record admin-manageable candidates during every review in items 2–9, but do not build the Admin CMS until item 10 — and Admin is explicitly scoped as a controlled, permissioned CMS, never unrestricted SQL/code editing.
- **Why:** The Pilot's build order (the design and implementation roadmaps above) was never in question, but nothing recorded the order of the *remaining launch-readiness gates* once building was done — leaving "what happens after the Pilot merges" implicit. Recording it prevents Admin QA or security work from jumping ahead of the account/journey/UI reviews they depend on, and prevents Admin-CMS scope from leaking into earlier review sessions.
- **Scope:** Documentation only — a third roadmap axis alongside the existing two, not a change to either of them, and not a feature-scope change. No code, schema, or existing roadmap item was altered.
- **Approved by:** User (Phase 0E staging-readiness reconciliation task, 2026-09-07).

### 2026-08-31 — Installer/Technician Pilot: follow-up items closed (O1–O7); no product blockers remain
- **What:** **O1 — verification:** an active organization member with `job.post` may create and manage a **draft** job, but **publishing it into Installer discovery requires the posting organization to be verified**. This is the canonical line, not an exception to it: verification gates public discoverability and trust, **not workspace access**. If verification is later lost the job **stops appearing in discovery and stops accepting new applications**, while **existing applications and assignments are preserved and remain manageable** — suppression is derived from the live organization row, never a stored transition. **O2 — review moderation:** reviews stay **immutable**; a reviewer may never edit or delete one and there is **no reviewer correction workflow** in the Pilot. A **separate append-only moderation/suppression record** lets Platform Support/Admin hide an abusive review from presentation **without altering or deleting the original evidence**; a full dispute workflow remains deferred. **O3 — availability:** **no automatic expiry or staleness cutoff**; `available_for_work` stays user-controlled and `availability_updated_at` is persisted and displayable. **No 7/14/30-day expiration policy may be invented.** **O4 — job closure:** **no automatic expiry**; an explicit manual **`closed`** state lets a poster close an unawarded job. Closed jobs accept no applications and are terminal; **reposting requires a new job**. The already-specified `awarded → open` re-award behaviour on assignment cancellation is preserved. **O5 — trade mismatch:** an installer **may apply to a job outside their declared specialties**. The trade taxonomy is a discovery/profile **signal, not an authorization boundary** — the UI may communicate a mismatch but must not prevent submission, and **no RLS policy or write path may use trade membership as application authority**. **O6 — reviewer identity:** a public review identifies the **posting organization**, never the individual member who submitted it; the acting user is preserved internally through audit/authority records only. **O7 — counter-offers:** negotiation is **out of the Pilot**. An application is submitted against the job's disclosed `offered_amount`/`offered_currency`, and **those fields become immutable once the first application exists**; changing the offer requires closing that job and creating a new one. **No negotiation, payment, wallet, settlement or counter-offer state is created.**
- **Why:** Each was a narrow question the specification could not answer from existing authority, and three of them (O1, O5, O7) change schema or authority checks, so they gated the Jobs database increment.
- **Scope:** **Documentation and specification only.** No migration, table, type, RPC, policy, view, index, seed row or application code. Updated: [`docs/database/installer-jobs.md`](../database/installer-jobs.md) and [`installer-pilot-implementation-map.md`](./installer-pilot-implementation-map.md).
- **Consequence:** **there are no remaining product blockers to the approved 14-increment Installer Pilot sequence.** Deferred, non-blocking work (full review dispute workflow, job-progress photos, chat attachments, organization ratings, geo data, AI matching, multi-trade jobs, multi-installer crews) is recorded in the specification.
- **Approved by:** User (Installer/Technician Pilot follow-up closure, 2026-08-31).

### 2026-08-31 — Installer/Technician Pilot: remaining decisions closed (D3-residual, D4–D10)
- **What:** The seven decisions left open by the entry below are closed. **D8 — canonical trade taxonomy:** a **database-backed** trade reference table plus the minimum user-specialty relation; an installer may hold **many** specialties, a job has **one** required primary trade, and onboarding, profile, Jobs and discovery all resolve against the same table. TypeScript vocabulary is no longer the long-term authority and **free text is never authorization or filter identity**. **D9 — compensation disclosure:** a Pilot job **carries and displays an offered amount** — positive, with an explicit currency, **EGP** for the Pilot — representing the organization's offered compensation. **Disclosure only: no wallet, escrow, payment status, payout, settlement, commission or invoice processing, and no surface may imply the amount has been paid.** **D10 — poster eligibility:** **any active organization** may post when the acting member holds `job.post`; management uses `job.manage`; `org.manage` keeps its blanket-management convention; **no `org_type` restriction**, since no canonical authority requires one; an `installer_technician` personal account never becomes a posting organization. **D4 — ratings:** exactly **one review per completed assignment**, target is the assigned installer, reviewer authority derives from the posting organization, creation only after completion, score **1–5** with optional text; rejected applications and cancelled assignments are never rateable; an installer cannot review themselves; the review is tied to the assignment that produced it. The UI may show average, total, the 1–5 distribution and the reviews list — **category/sub-rating dimensions, satisfaction percentages, quality/cleanliness/value scores and recommendation badges are not approved.** **D5 — storage first:** portfolio and certificates require a **real** Media/Storage foundation, specified and implemented **before** any upload UI; **no temporary public-URL fields and no fake media records**; Jobs/applications/assignments do not depend on it; job-progress photos and Chat attachments may later use the same foundation but are **not** integrated now. **D6 — availability:** a simple, persisted, **user-controlled** available-for-work state usable by profile/dashboard and future discovery filtering — **not** online presence, Realtime presence, calendar scheduling or shift management. **D7 — settings:** **no new settings domain**; Installer Settings composes existing capabilities (profile editing, availability, service areas, locale, appearance, existing account/security surfaces), with **notification preferences out of scope** until separately specified. **D3-residual — Sales-affiliation hardening:** a **minimal** security increment persona-gates `showroom_join_request_create` (and the referral write paths) so an `installer_technician` cannot obtain `sales.*`, **without redesigning existing Sales affiliation behaviour**.
- **Also confirmed:** the **organization-side Jobs flow is required Pilot scope** — an Installer discovery experience without a real authoritative posting path is not shippable. The end-to-end flow (organization: create → publish → review applicants → accept → assignment → monitor → complete → review; installer: discover → details → apply → track → assignment → My Work → progress → poster-confirmed completion → review on the professional profile) is recorded in the specification.
- **Why:** The Installer Pilot cannot ship a persona end-to-end while its trade vocabulary, compensation disclosure, poster eligibility, rating contract, media dependency, availability state and settings composition are undecided — each one changes schema or authority.
- **Scope:** **Documentation and specification only.** No migration, table, type, RPC, policy, view, index, seed row or application code. Updated: [`docs/database/installer-jobs.md`](../database/installer-jobs.md) and [`installer-pilot-implementation-map.md`](./installer-pilot-implementation-map.md), plus one clarifying sentence in [`mvp-scope.md`](./mvp-scope.md) distinguishing a displayed offered amount from payment.
- **Explicitly unchanged:** `UI-UX/design.pen` · Notifications · Transactional Chat · Points Core (**no job event earns Points**) · the RFQ/quotation/order/project spine · all supply-side behavior · existing Sales affiliation *behaviour* (D3-residual adds a persona gate only).
- **Remaining open at the time of this entry:** seven narrow items O1–O7. **All closed the same day — see the entry above.** Note that O1 was resolved *differently* from the reading proposed here: verification does not gate workspace access, but it **does** gate publishing into discovery.
- **Approved by:** User (Installer/Technician Pilot decision closure, 2026-08-31).

### 2026-08-31 — Installer/Technician Pilot: jobs and work lifecycle pulled into scope; Installer↔Showroom is not a Sales membership
- **What:** Three approved decisions. **(D1)** Installer **job opportunities and the complete work lifecycle** are pulled **into the Pilot** for `installer_technician`, superseding the post-MVP deferral of the *installation & service marketplace* and *project-execution workflow* for that persona. The milestone must deliver the persona end-to-end, not identity/profile-only. **(D2)** The authority model is a **new personal-work domain — an organization posts, an individual `installer_technician` user applies.** The existing organization↔organization commerce spine (RFQ · quotation · order · project) **remains unchanged**: no nullable `requester_org_id`/`supplier_org_id`/`executing_org_id`, no weakened commerce RLS or distinct-party constraints, and **no shadow one-person organizations for installers**. **(D3)** An Installer's showroom/business network is **not** a Sales membership: the `showroom_join_request_create` → `app.membership_grant_sales` path must not be its implementation, and an installer must never gain Sales capabilities by knowing, referring, working with or connecting to a showroom. The network is instead a **derived, read-only projection of completed work** — no relationship table, no membership, no capability.
- **Why:** The Installer audit proved the commerce model cannot carry person-level work: `rfqs`, `orders`, `projects` and `conversations` are organization↔organization by `NOT NULL` plus `CHECK`, `projects` has no assignee column at all, and an installer may legitimately hold zero organizations. Faking jobs from those tables would have required either a shadow organization (contradicting the canonical account model) or nullable party columns (dissolving the tenant-isolation spine every RLS policy depends on). A separate domain was the only option that delivers the persona without weakening what ships today.
- **Also settled in specification:** an accepted application does **not** own the work lifecycle — a separate `job_assignments` engagement record does, for auditability (an application must stop changing once decided) and because a rating must anchor to a narrow FK where every row is real work. Completion is confirmed by the **posting organization**, never self-declared by the installer, so the rating anchor is evidence.
- **Scope:** **Documentation and specification only.** No migration, table, type, RPC, policy, view, index, seed row or application code. New: [`docs/database/installer-jobs.md`](../database/installer-jobs.md). Updated: [`mvp-scope.md`](./mvp-scope.md) deferred list + build order, this guide's long-term list, and [`installer-pilot-implementation-map.md`](./installer-pilot-implementation-map.md).
- **Explicitly unchanged:** `UI-UX/design.pen` · Notifications (closed event-type `CHECK`) · Transactional Chat (org↔org, closed `subject_type`) · Points Core (user-owned; `referral.organization_approved` = +100 remains the only earning event; **no job event earns Points**) · all supply-side behavior · the existing Sales affiliation flow. The transactional messaging expansion (full Chat Center, personal↔organization chat, Realtime, attachments) is the **next** milestone, so Installer surfaces ship without messaging entry points.
- **Recorded debt:** `showroom_join_request_create` does not gate on persona, so a non-Sales persona can today request showroom affiliation and receive Sales capabilities on approval. Documented, deliberately **not** modified in this milestone, and tracked as D3-residual.
- **Remaining open at the time of this entry:** D4 ratings shape · D5 media/storage approach · D6 live availability · D7 personal settings scope · D8 trade taxonomy in the database · D9 job compensation disclosure · D10 which org types may post. **All closed the same day — see the entry above.**
- **Approved by:** User (Installer/Technician Pilot product decisions, 2026-08-31).

### 2026-08-17 — Reconciled the 2026-08-08 Private-Pilot B2B decisions onto main
- **What:** Recovered the approved 2026-08-08 product decisions from commit `d7f947e` and ported **only** what survives against the implemented product: the free-Pilot / no-payment boundary, Arabic-default with exact English parity, progressive-disclosure need capture, and the deferred advanced-B2B capabilities. Recorded the superseded decisions and what replaced each of them in *Private-Pilot B2B Scope Boundaries*.
- **Why:** Those decisions were approved but never reached `main`, while Sprints 9–14 implemented the B2B workflow differently. Reconciling — rather than merging the stale commit — keeps the implemented product authoritative and stops the lost decisions from being re-litigated.
- **Approved by:** Product Owner (2026-08-08 B2B closure); reconciliation scope confirmed 2026-08-17.

### 2026-08-12 — Account & Workspace Model implemented
- **What:** The model recorded in the two entries below is now **built**, not just documented. `users.primary_account_type` is **nullable, has no default, and means personal persona only**; a **business-only identity legitimately has no personal persona**, which the old `not null default 'end_consumer'` column could not even represent. `organizations.org_type` remains the sole business classification and is never mirrored onto a user; `request_account_upgrade` refuses business values outright. Business creation moved to a **per-attempt draft** (`business_creation_drafts`) whose id is both the resume handle and the **idempotency key**, replacing the one-draft-per-user shape that structurally prevented a second business — so retries return the same organization while a new draft legitimately creates another. Registration became a **direct Personal-or-Business choice** with concrete business types; the generic **"Organization owner / manager" entry is no longer offered** and the owner/manager confirmation is gone (the creator *is* the owner). An existing user can **add a business** from the workspace menu with no second sign-up, and a **workspace switcher** changes the active work context — Personal or any organization with an active membership — without ever touching persona or membership. Landing is deterministic, and merely belonging to an organization no longer evicts a person from their personal `/home`.
- **Why:** The Pilot UAT alignment recorded the model but left the schema unable to express it; business owners were carrying their organization's type as a personal identity, and no user could own a second business.
- **Scope:** Two migrations (`20260814090001`, `20260814090002`), frontend work-context/registration/business-creation changes, Admin compatibility, EN/AR copy. Legacy rows preserved; no user, organization, membership, branch, capability, or commercial record created or destroyed by the migration. Build notes: [`docs/frontend/sprint-12-account-workspace-model.md`](../frontend/sprint-12-account-workspace-model.md).
- **Remaining debt:** the `account_type` enum still contains the business members because `organizations.org_type` is typed with it — correct for the organization, unreachable for a person; splitting it is a separate mechanical migration.
- **Approved by:** User (Pilot Account & Workspace Model feature sprint, 2026-08-12).

### 2026-08-12 — Business classification belongs to the Organization
- **What:** Resolved the remaining ambiguity around business types. **Concrete business classifications** (Showroom/Dealer · Supplier · Manufacturer · Importer · Wholesaler · contractor company · design/engineering office · future classifications) are canonically **`organizations.org_type`** and must never be treated as a person's long-term personal identity. **`users.primary_account_type` represents personal identity/persona state**, not the type of every business the user owns or joins — a single value cannot be `showroom_dealer` *and* `importer` at once, which the multi-organization model requires (*Ahmed Hassan*: persona Engineer · *AH Showroom* `showroom_dealer` · *AH Import* `importer`, same user ID). **Registration UX is unchanged** — picking *"I am a Showroom"* stays, but it architecturally means *"I am creating a business whose `org_type` is X"*, and the backend creates Organization + Owner Membership + Primary Branch in one transactional, idempotent operation. Existing business-valued `primary_account_type`/account-type paths are recorded as **transitional technical debt** to be audited and migrated by the upcoming Account & Workspace Model feature, never duplicated into a second source of truth.
- **Why:** The docs still listed business classifications among the capacities of a *person*, which contradicts the approved multi-organization model and would push implementers to mirror `org_type` into the user.
- **Scope:** Documentation only. **No database enum, migration, schema, code, or test change** in this PR.
- **Approved by:** User (Pilot UAT account-model clarification, 2026-08-12).

### 2026-08-12 — Account / organization / workspace model made canonical
- **What:** Recorded the approved account-and-workspace model as canonical: **one person = one user ID** (another business never creates another user); **personal identity is not a business** and a personal professional may hold **zero** organizations; **a business is an Organization** created once in the UX (backend transactionally creates organization + owner membership + primary branch); **Membership** is the only user↔organization link and owns relationship, capabilities, branch scope, and lifecycle; **one user may hold zero/one/many organizations on the same login**; **Workspace is a derived UX concept** (Personal = User+Profile, Business = Organization+active Membership) with **no `workspaces` table**; an **existing user can create a business later** with no second sign-up; a **single-source-of-truth ownership table** forbidding identity duplication in either direction; **duplicate-business protection** (transactional + idempotent creation, name alone is never the permanent identity); **membership history survives leaving**; and the **approved future account-lifecycle rule** (deactivate reversible · delete request → grace period → identity released, history retained · a reused email/phone gets a NEW user ID inheriting nothing · muted historical attribution) which is **explicitly not implemented**. **Clarified the no-profile-switcher rule:** switching *personas/account identities* stays forbidden; switching the *active work context* between the personal surface and organizations where the same user has an **active membership** is allowed and is not persona switching. **Owner/Manager** was restated as a **relationship**, never an account or business type, with the target *personal persona OR concrete business type* registration UX recorded and the generic owner/manager entry demoted to **transitional backward-compatibility** behaviour.
- **Why:** The Pilot UAT discussion surfaced that the docs implied a business was a second account and that any context switching was forbidden — which blocks the approved multi-organization model and would have driven duplicate users, duplicated identity data, and duplicate organizations. Documentation alignment only: **no workspace switcher and no account lifecycle is implemented in this patch.**

### 2026-08-11 — Activation vs. verification; owner/manager is not a business type
- **What:** Added the *Activation vs. Verification* rule and the *"Organization owner / manager" is not a business type* rule. Completing onboarding now activates a personal account and the user reaches `/home`; verification became an independent trust state that gates discoverability, not access. Profile completeness was defined as an always-derived signal that excludes verification. The generic owner/manager registration entry carries no `account_type`; the real organization type is chosen during business onboarding.
- **Why:** Manual Pilot testing found consumers and individual professionals trapped after finishing onboarding — an Admin approval was the de-facto activation mechanism — and the generic owner/manager path failed outright with a generic save error.
- **Approved by:** User (Pilot UAT fix round 1 task, 2026-08-11).

### 2026-07-30 — Canonical memory promotion + account-model correction
- **What:** Promoted this guide to a canonical project-memory file (`product-direction.md` → `PRODUCT_DIRECTION_GUIDE.md`, history preserved via `git mv`). Added the metadata block, an explicit dual roadmap (design + implementation), the product-decision process, and this change history. **Corrected the account model** from "active-profile switching" to the canonical **one-current-primary-account-type / no-profile-switcher / derived-navigation** model across all product statements.
- **Why:** Establish enforceable project memory and remove the profile-switching contradiction; align with the canonical identity model. This is a **wording/consistency correction of the identity model, not a change to product strategy.**
- **Approved by:** User (memory-consolidation task, 2026-07-30).

### 2026-07-29/30 — Initial product-direction guide
- **What:** First version created during the repository architecture foundation session — vision, positioning, philosophy, priority rules, and "agents must never" guardrails.
- **Why:** Give agents a durable "why and where" above the MVP scope and ADRs.
- **Approved by:** User (foundation session).

## Approved Showroom onboarding refinement — 2026-10-14

Product-owner review explicitly requires showroom entity phone, optional email and one existing showroom activity in Step 1. Governorate and city/area are mandatory in Step 2. Subsequent review makes the detailed address optional during onboarding (max 250 words), tracked later in showroom account completion; short description max 250 characters. Initial creation never grants approval or verifies contacts. Scope and rationale: [implementation report](../frontend/showroom-business-onboarding.md). **Change history:** 2026-10-14, explicit product-owner instructions and browser review comments.

## Approved Showroom rollout change — 2026-10-14
Owner approved detailed address optional during onboarding, mandatory before approval/activation/new selling. Existing approved active missing-address showrooms retain captured published products and order operations only; new publication requires completion. No automatic deactivation/unpublication. Mark profile incomplete, record narrowly scoped historical exceptions and close on completion. Staging impact is not production evidence. See ADR-0015 and docs/frontend/showroom-business-onboarding.md; no deployment authorized.
