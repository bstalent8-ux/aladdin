# Architecture Guide

## 2026-10-17 — Approved local RC2 R2 integration

The owner authorized a dedicated integration branch based on exact RC2 main8bde19c4 and163 migrations. Original R2 worktree is preserved. Scope includes forward-only schema/permission reconciliation, actual-byte receipts, mixed providers and private application delivery for existing personal media plus RC2 product images and organization logos; preserve every current tenant/audience/org.manage/ordering rule. No hosted resource, cleanup, deployment, push or merge is authorized. Both R2 flagsfalse. Architecture: [ADR-0017](../decisions/ADR-0017-rc2-private-media-integration.md). Integration in progress; acceptance results must be recorded before completion.

This is **core architecture**, not optional documentation.

## Current Architecture Summary
Aladdin is a **modular monolith** built from four cooperating parts (ADR-0001):

1. **Web application** — Next.js (App Router) · React · TypeScript strict · Tailwind. The primary product surface and the primary CRUD path against Supabase.
2. **Data platform** — Supabase: PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, RLS, Realtime, Queues, FTS, `pg_trgm`, `pgvector`, PostGIS.
3. **Specialized service** — Python 3.12+ / FastAPI for AI, OCR, RAG, documents, chunking, embeddings, evaluations, NLP, large-Excel, and workers. **Not** the CRUD backend.
4. **Background workers** — only where asynchronous processing is genuinely required.

As of 2026-07-30 the foundation is **scaffolded**: services build and pass their checks; **no product features, tables, or production connections exist yet.**

## Modular-Monolith Decision
One well-structured monolith with clean module boundaries — not premature microservices (ADR-0001). Module boundaries are kept clean enough that a domain can be **extracted later** without a rewrite, but nothing is extracted speculatively. See [Scalability Stages](#scalability-stages--extraction-triggers).

## Web Application Responsibilities
- All standard product CRUD and user-facing flows: Server Components by default, Server Actions for mutations, Route Handlers for webhooks/BFF/integrations.
- Talks to Supabase via **`supabase-js`**, preserving the authenticated user's JWT so **RLS is the enforcement layer**.
- Owns i18n (AR-RTL / EN-LTR), theming (light/dark), and PWA/responsive behavior.
- Holds no service-role secret in client code — only validated `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values reach the browser.

## Design System (frontend)

The Aladdin Design System — **"The Aperture"** — is part of the architecture, not incidental styling. It is **finalized and semantically versioned** (`1.0.0`, approved/hardened, pre-feature):

- **Authority chain:** [`../product/PRODUCT_DIRECTION_GUIDE.md`](../product/PRODUCT_DIRECTION_GUIDE.md) → root [`../../DESIGN.md`](../../DESIGN.md) → [`../../design/tokens/*.json`](../../design/tokens/) (canonical machine tokens) → [`../../UI-UX/UI_UX_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md`](../../UI-UX/UI_UX_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md) → `UI-UX/design.pen` → frontend CSS variables + Tailwind config.
- **Governance:** [`../../design/GOVERNANCE.md`](../../design/GOVERNANCE.md) (versioning, synchronization, component & AI-agent rules); changelog [`../../design/CHANGELOG.md`](../../design/CHANGELOG.md).
- **Implementation:** `frontend/src/styles/tokens.css` (CSS vars, light/dark), `frontend/tailwind.config.ts` (theme), `next/font` in `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`. Frontend code consumes **semantic** tokens; it never invents values outside the canonical tokens.

Token/brand changes follow the design-system edit-order (token JSON first) and update the design-system memory files in the same change — analogous to the [Architecture-Change Process](#architecture-change-process) for architecture.

## FastAPI Service Responsibilities
- **Specialized workloads only:** AI orchestration, OCR, document processing/chunking, embeddings, RAG, AI evaluations, NLP, large-Excel processing, and background/queue handlers.
- **Does not recreate application CRUD.** If a feature can be a Server Action / Route Handler against Supabase, it belongs in the web app, not here.
- Talks to Supabase/Postgres via **`supabase-py`** (see [Python Data-Access Decision](#python-data-access-decision)).
- Verifies the Supabase JWT on every request and derives identity from the token (`app/auth`: local JWKS verification; `require_active_principal` also refuses suspended accounts and ended sessions).
- Owns non-CRUD **media jobs**: the historical-media purge and the video transcode/purge worker ([ADR-0020](../decisions/ADR-0020-video-r2-hls.md)), the R2 variant backfill next ([ADR-0018 Revision 2](../decisions/ADR-0018-r2-edge-media-delivery.md#revision-2--2026-10-19-full-media-architecture)).

## Supabase Platform Responsibilities
- **PostgreSQL** — the single shared database and the system of record.
- **Auth** — Email + Password identity with Email OTP verification and Email OTP recovery (installer/technician exception: Phone + Password via an internal login alias), JWT issuance. *(Superseded 2026-09-28: passwordless WhatsApp/Email OTP identity.)*
- **Storage** — files/documents with storage policies.
- **RLS** — the tenant-isolation spine for all tenant/user/verification/sales/project/file/AI data.
- **Realtime** — live status streams (see [Realtime Responsibilities](#realtime-responsibilities)).
- **Queues** — background-job hand-off (see [Queue / Background-Job Responsibilities](#queue--background-job-responsibilities)).
- **Extensions** — FTS, `pg_trgm`, `pgvector`, PostGIS, `pgcrypto` (installed via the extensions migration).

## Module Boundaries
- The web app is organized by **feature/domain** modules; the FastAPI service is organized by **capability** modules (`ai`, `retrieval`, `documents`, `ocr`, `ingestion`, `embeddings`, `workers`, plus cross-cutting `auth`, `database`, `schemas`, `security`, `observability`).
- Cross-module access goes through explicit interfaces, not reach-ins. Shared truth is the database schema (owned by migrations), not shared in-process state.
- The web↔FastAPI boundary is an authenticated HTTP boundary; neither shares a process or an ORM with the other.

## Data Ownership
- **The database schema is owned exclusively by `supabase/migrations/*.sql`** (ADR-0002). No application component — JS or Python — creates or alters schema.
- The web app owns user-facing CRUD; the FastAPI service owns derived/AI artifacts (embeddings, extractions, evaluations) it writes back through the same RLS-governed tables.
- No second database. No per-service private schema unless a future ADR introduces one.
- **Organization activity is a PII-minimised projection, never a view over the security audit.** `public.audit_log` remains platform-administrator-only; the single audit writer atomically copies only allow-listed business actions and explicitly named safe parameters into the separately RLS-governed `organization_activity_events` table ([ADR-0010](../decisions/ADR-0010-organization-activity-log.md)).

## Multi-Tenancy Model
- The **tenant unit is the organization**, with **branch** scoping where applicable.
- **RLS is the isolation spine** — cross-tenant data must never leak in UI, API, worker, or AI retrieval.
- Tenancy attaches to the canonical identity via organization membership + branch assignment; it does not fork the account. One user may hold **zero, one, or many** memberships on the same identity, and a personal (organization-less) account is fully valid.

## Identity & Authorization Model
- **One person = one user ID.** One canonical identity per person (Email + Password, or the installer Phone + Password exception); creating or joining another business never creates a second auth user. A business is an **Organization**, never a second account. See the [Product Direction Guide](../product/PRODUCT_DIRECTION_GUIDE.md) *Canonical Identity Model*, *Personal Identity Is Not a Business*, and *Switching*.
- **One current primary account type** at a time — **no persona/profile switcher**. What a user can see/do is **derived** from primary account type, organization membership, branch assignment, permission capabilities, verification state, and subscription state.
- **Work context ≠ identity.** Switching the active work context between the personal surface (User+Profile) and an organization where the same user holds an **active membership** (Organization+Membership) is allowed and is *not* persona switching. Both workspaces are **derived** — there is no `workspaces` table.
- **No duplicated identity.** Personal identity lives in `users`/`profiles`, business identity in `organizations`, and the relationship in `memberships`; neither side is copied into the other as a second source of truth (onboarding drafts excepted, until commit).
- **Business classification is an organization property, enforced by the type system.** Two **disjoint** database types carry the two taxonomies: `public.persona_type` (a person — consumer, engineer, interior designer, installer/technician, contractor, salesperson, trainer, trainee) and `public.organization_type` (a business — showroom/dealer, supplier, manufacturer, importer, wholesaler, contractor company, design office). `users.primary_account_type` is a `persona_type` and is **nullable** (a business-only identity has no personal persona); `organizations.org_type` is an `organization_type`. Since the value sets do not overlap, `users.primary_account_type = 'supplier'` and `organizations.org_type = 'engineer'` are **type errors in every path**, including direct SQL. The shared `account_type` enum was dropped in Sprint 13 (migration `20260815090001`); the transitional debt is closed.
- **Affiliation is a membership, not an account type.** A salesperson working in someone else's showroom holds an ACTIVE `memberships` row with the sales capability set — never `org.manage`, and never a business classification on their person. Requests to join (`organization_join_requests`) and referred business candidates (`organization_referrals`) are *requests*: they grant nothing, are decided through the existing `org.members.manage` capability or platform authority respectively, and converge on `app.membership_grant_sales` so "approved" means one thing. Referral provenance (`organizations.source`, `organizations.referred_by_user_id`) is write-once and confers no relationship.
- **Effective personal persona = declared ?? canonical.** `app.effective_persona(uid)` resolves `individual_onboarding.prof_concrete_type` (declared — written by registration's account-type RPC or the professional editor) before `users.primary_account_type` (canonical — Admin-applied, trust-reviewed). Professional gates (`app.is_professional_persona`, `app.is_sales_persona`) accept either; persona-scoped writes (`user_activities_set`) and `my_profile_completion()` use the resolved value. Registration never writes the canonical column, never overrides a different canonical persona, and never creates a membership or capability (migration `20260924090011`).
- **User identity settings are workspace-independent.** `/settings/profile` requires only application access (`access_ready` / `active_personal`) — never a personal workspace or a membership. Organization-scoped editing (organization activities/subtypes) stays on `/b2b/settings` behind `org.manage`.
- **Supabase Auth verifies CAPTCHA tokens** ([ADR-0023](../decisions/ADR-0023-supabase-auth-verifies-turnstile.md), [auth-captcha.md](../frontend/auth-captcha.md)). Every Supabase Auth call that takes a token (sign up, resend, password sign in, email code, recovery) forwards the Turnstile token; hosted projects run Supabase Auth CAPTCHA protection ON (Turnstile), so direct `/auth/v1` calls are covered too. The app calls Cloudflare Siteverify (`frontend/src/server/auth/turnstile.ts`, server-only `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`, hostname + action, fail closed) only for the phone sign-up's Admin-API account creation. One verifier per token. Server-side checks never use a password grant (`account_password_confirm` instead). Local `config.toml` keeps it off; CI turns it on with test secrets. Until the hosted switch is on, hosted projects only check presence.
- **Installer phone login alias (permanent, role-specific).** `/installer/sign-up` creates ordinary installer/technician accounts whose Supabase Auth email is an internal, undeliverable alias derived from the canonical E.164 phone (`p<digits>@craftsman-login.aladdin.invalid`, `email_confirm: true`, `app_metadata.registration_source = "temporary_craftsman_password_flow"`). It is a login key, never a contact: app surfaces render the auth email only through `userFacingEmail()` and `app.mask_email` masks the alias to `•••`. Service role is used only for the phone-uniqueness read, user creation and rollback delete; everything else runs as the user under RLS. See [`../frontend/installer-phone-auth.md`](../frontend/installer-phone-auth.md).
- **Authorization is enforced server-side** (RLS + explicit permission checks). The UI never implies access it cannot grant. Identity is always derived from the verified JWT, never from a request body.
- **Platform (Admin) authority is dynamic RBAC — one source (Phase 1A, [ADR-0011](../decisions/ADR-0011-admin-rbac-platform-authority.md), Accepted).** `admin_role_assignments` is the only source of platform authority, checked by `app.has_admin_permission()` in RPCs/RLS and read by the frontend only through `admin_my_access()` (`server/authorization/admin.ts`, one route→permission table in `lib/permissions/admin.ts`, every Admin page guards its own route). `platform_role_grants` is a never-read, one-way compatibility bridge until retirement ([`ADMIN_RBAC_ARCHITECTURE.md` §6](../admin/ADMIN_RBAC_ARCHITECTURE.md)); `app.is_platform()` is a deprecated shim over the same assignments. Tenant authority (`membership_capabilities`) is unchanged.
- **Admin Users / Organizations reads are server-side RPCs (Phase 1B-A, awaiting approval).** `admin_users_list` / `admin_user_detail` (`users.read`) and `admin_organizations_list` / `admin_organization_detail` (`organizations.read`) — platform-scoped, security-definer, deterministic (primary-key tie-break), paging/search/filter/sort over the full dataset in Postgres; the frontend reads them through `server/queries/admin-directory.ts` with one URL parser (`features/admin-preview/directory-params.ts`). Profile completion has ONE formula, `app.profile_completion(user_id)`, which `my_profile_completion()` wraps. Account email is read from `auth.users` only inside those RPCs (Installer login alias excluded). Details: [`ADMIN_USERS_ORGS_READ_AUDIT.md`](../admin/ADMIN_USERS_ORGS_READ_AUDIT.md).
- **Suspension is enforced by the database, centrally (Admin Core Phase 1B-B, awaiting approval).** A PostgREST `db_pre_request` hook refuses every Data API request from a suspended/deactivated account except `my_account_status`; `has_capability` / `is_org_member` / `require_verified_caller` / the personal storage helpers treat such a caller as having no authority (Storage/Realtime paths). A suspended **organization** keeps only its `.read` capabilities (members untouched). The middleware routes a suspended account to `/auth/suspended`. Admin Notes (append-only), Follow-ups (derived status), internal Cases, the Entity Timeline and organization duplicate resolution are security-definer RPCs behind their own `resource.action` permissions. The hook's entry point is `pgrst_hooks.pre_request()` (migration `20260930100005`), a one-function schema that delegates to the canonical `app.api_pre_request()` so every request role (including `service_role`, which must NOT get `USAGE` on schema `app`) can resolve it; the original direct configuration broke service-role requests in Production and is currently disabled there — see [`POSTGREST_PRE_REQUEST_HOOK.md`](../admin/POSTGREST_PRE_REQUEST_HOOK.md). Details: [`ADMIN_USER_ORG_OPERATIONS.md`](../admin/ADMIN_USER_ORG_OPERATIONS.md).
- **Per-request session reads (WP8, 2026-10-18, not deployed).** Middleware verifies the session JWT locally with `auth.getClaims()` (ES256 / JWKS) and keeps the `my_account_status` suspension redirect on every non-prefetch product-surface request; `/admin/**` still calls the network `auth.getUser()`. Server code reads identity through `server/auth/session.ts`: `getSessionIdentity()` / `readSessionIdentity(client)` (`cache()`d claims) for read-only loaders, `getCurrentUser()` (`cache()`d `getUser()`) for admin and account-security pages; privileged Server Actions keep their own `getUser()`. RLS and the DB suspension helpers remain the authority; the residual window is a revoked (not suspended) session navigating non-admin pages until `exp` (`jwt_expiry` 3600 s). Details and request counts: [auth-session-reads.md](../frontend/auth-session-reads.md).

## RLS Strategy
- RLS is **mandatory** on every tenant/user/verification/sales/project/file/AI table; every policy ships with tests (pgTAP + isolation tests).
- Policies are SQL and version as migrations alongside the tables they protect.
- Service-role access **bypasses RLS** and is therefore restricted to trusted internal workers and explicitly authorized operations only. Detail: [`../security/rls-strategy.md`](../security/rls-strategy.md).

## Storage Security
- Supabase Storage buckets are governed by storage policies (also SQL migrations).
- Private design IP (`.pen`) and customer documents never enter Git; document access is authorized per-organization the same way row data is.

## Media Storage & Delivery
**Status: proposed, not in effect.** The design is [ADR-0018](../decisions/ADR-0018-r2-edge-media-delivery.md) (Proposed, needs owner approval), which refines [ADR-0017](../decisions/ADR-0017-rc2-private-media-integration.md). The code is on draft PR #89, unmerged, with edge delivery off. On `main`, media is still served from Supabase Storage.

- **Authority stays in Postgres.** `media_storage_locations` records the provider (`supabase` or `r2`), size, sha256, receipt and variants for each object. `media_storage_resolve` and `organization_media_resolve` decide every read, upload and delete.
- **Store.** A private Cloudflare R2 bucket holds avatars, portfolio, certificates, product images and organization logos. **Business-verification documents stay in their own Supabase bucket, unchanged** (PR #88 contract). Purchase-request images also stay on Supabase.
- **No media is unconditionally public.** Published portfolio photos and listed avatars are conditional: unpublishing, delisting, suspension or deletion withdraws them on the next request. Everything else is private.
- **Delivery.** When `MEDIA_EDGE_DELIVERY_ENABLED=true`, R2 rows are served by the `media-edge` Worker (`edge/media-worker/`). Private reads need a 120 s HMAC ticket minted by the app; public reads need none. Every request calls Postgres through Hyperdrive with caching off. Otherwise, and for Supabase rows, the app proxy serves them (`/api/media/<ns>`, `/p/media/<itemId>`, `no-store`).
- **Variants.** WebP `thumb` 320, `card` 768 and `full` 1600 px are generated from the verified original and stored at `v/<ns>/<key>/<variant>.webp`.
- **Hosting.** The Worker is a media edge beside Supabase Storage. It is not a Vercel service and not the background-worker host; [ADR-0009](../decisions/ADR-0009-vercel-services-deployment.md) is unchanged.
- **Historical Supabase media is deleted, not migrated** (2026-10-19): portfolio photos and avatars before a cutoff are purged by a resumable, database-confirmed backend job; certificates and verification evidence are never touched. Products and logos stay private (no guest catalog). Media hostname `media.aladdindecore.com` (Pages + CNAME, or a Cloudflare zone). Responsibilities, costs, failure handling and rollback: ADR-0018 Revision 2.
- **Video (proposed, [ADR-0020](../decisions/ADR-0020-video-r2-hls.md), behind `VIDEO_ENABLED=false`).** Browsers upload originals straight to the private R2 bucket in presigned multipart parts; a separate ffmpeg worker (`backend/app/workers/video_transcode.py`) writes adaptive HLS and a poster to R2; the media Worker serves `/v/` with a Postgres decision (`media_edge_video`) on every playlist and segment. No video byte passes through Supabase or Vercel. The transcode host is a deployment dependency still to be approved.
- **Session revocation on the Data API.** The `db_pre_request` hook refuses a signed-out, banned or deleted session on its next request (migration `20261021090013`), not at JWT expiry. Storage and Realtime do not run that hook, so restrictive `app.jwt_session_is_live()` policies cover them: `storage.objects` (every command) and the two Realtime-published tables `leads` and `follow_up_tasks` (migration `20261021090014`, pgTAP `103_*`). A table added to the `supabase_realtime` publication needs the same policy; pgTAP `103_*` fails without it.
- Runbooks: [media monitoring and migration](../operations/media-monitoring.md) · [Worker setup](../../edge/media-worker/README.md) · [professional media contract](../database/professional-asset-storage.md).

## Realtime Responsibilities
Supabase Realtime carries live status for: notifications, opportunity/pipeline status, task updates, verification status, project activity, inventory availability, and quotation status. Realtime is a delivery channel, not a source of truth — the database remains authoritative.

## Queue / Background-Job Responsibilities
- Heavy/slow/external work runs **off the request path** via Supabase Queues + Python workers: OCR, embeddings, document chunking, Excel imports, PDF/document generation, email + operational WhatsApp delivery, and expensive analytics refreshes. No worker is implemented yet and **its host is deliberately undecided** ([ADR-0009](../decisions/ADR-0009-vercel-services-deployment.md)).
- Request handlers stay fast; the UI reflects progress via Realtime. Never run blocking AI/OCR/parsing in a request event loop.

## AI, OCR, RAG & Embedding Boundaries
- All of these live in the **FastAPI service**, not the web app.
- **Retrieval applies authorization filters before returning content** — vector/document search must never cross organizations.
- AI **drafts, explains, and ranks; it never auto-sends** or takes irreversible action without human review.
- Embeddings/extractions are persisted through RLS-governed tables owned by migrations.

## Database Migration Ownership
- **`supabase/migrations/*.sql` is the only schema source of truth** (ADR-0002). Every change is a new, ordered SQL migration reviewed as a concrete artifact (tables, policies, grants, indexes).
- **No Alembic. No `Base.metadata.create_all()` in Staging/Production.** Production schema is never changed by hand once the migration workflow is established.

## Python Data-Access Decision
Current decision (ADR-0005, refining ADR-0002 for the Private Pilot MVP):

- **Next.js uses `supabase-js`; FastAPI and trusted Python workers use `supabase-py`.**
- Complex database operations use **PostgreSQL functions / RPC** where appropriate.
- **User-facing operations preserve the authenticated user JWT and RLS context.** Service-role access is restricted to trusted internal workers and explicitly authorized operations.
- **SQLAlchemy is deferred** until an evidenced requirement exists; it is **not** a current dependency. **Alembic remains prohibited** for the shared Supabase database.
- If a future need for typed SQL composition / connection pooling is evidenced, **SQLAlchemy Core** (not the ORM, never Alembic) may be reconsidered via a new ADR. Migration path and triggers are in [ADR-0005](../decisions/ADR-0005-python-data-access.md).

## Environment / Configuration Model
- One validated settings module per service is the **only** config source: `frontend/src/lib/env/` (Zod-validated) and `backend/app/config.py` (Pydantic Settings).
- **Never** read `process.env` / `os.getenv` in application code; **never** call `load_dotenv`.
- **Fail fast** on missing required config; **no silent defaults for secrets**. Each service ships a `.env.example`. Real `.env` files are never committed. Detail: [`../security/secrets-and-environments.md`](../security/secrets-and-environments.md).

## Deployment Targets
- **Vercel Services** — **both** the Next.js web app (`services.frontend`) and the FastAPI service (`services.backend`, Python runtime), declared in the repository-root `vercel.json` and shipped as **one deployment unit**: one preview URL per PR covering both, one rollback restoring both. Path rewrites put FastAPI same-origin at **`/api/backend`**, so there is no absolute backend URL to configure per environment. This does not relax the boundary — FastAPI is called from the **server side** of the web app, never the browser.
- **Worker host — undecided.** `backend/app/workers/` is interface-only; a new ADR picks between Vercel Cron/Queues and a container host when the first worker is implemented. `backend/Dockerfile` is retained as the portability exit path.
- **Supabase** — Postgres/Auth/Storage/Realtime/Queues.
- **OpenAI** — LLM/embeddings. **Azure Document Intelligence** — OCR candidate. **Sentry** — error tracking.

Staging precedes Production; migrations are backward-compatible. Detail: [ADR-0009](../decisions/ADR-0009-vercel-services-deployment.md) (supersedes [ADR-0004](../decisions/ADR-0004-deployment-platforms.md) on hosting) · [`../operations/deployment-overview.md`](../operations/deployment-overview.md).

## Observability
Structured logging (`structlog` in FastAPI), Sentry for errors across web + service, and health endpoints (`/api/health` web, `/health` FastAPI). Detail: [`../operations/monitoring-and-observability.md`](../operations/monitoring-and-observability.md).

## Performance Strategy
- **Postgres-first** search/analytics (FTS / `pg_trgm` / `pgvector`); expensive aggregations refresh asynchronously.
- Server-side pagination/sort/filter for large sets; never fetch unbounded rows.
- Long/expensive work is queued, not run inline; the UI stays responsive with live status.

## Scalability Stages & Extraction Triggers
Ship the monolith; move to the next rung only against **measured** need:
1. **Now** — modular monolith on the approved stack.
2. **Vertical scaling + Postgres tuning** — indexes, read patterns, connection management.
3. **Worker scale-out** — more worker instances behind Supabase Queues for AI/OCR/import load.
4. **Service extraction** — extract a domain **only** when a measured bottleneck or team-scaling need justifies it, using the clean module boundaries already in place.

Options are documented, not pre-built. Detail: [`scaling-strategy.md`](./scaling-strategy.md).

## Explicit Non-Goals
No Kubernetes, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, event sourcing, CQRS frameworks, service mesh, API gateway, or additional databases — unless an existing approved requirement makes it unavoidable and a new ADR records it. No Vite / React SPA / React Router. No Alembic. No second CRUD backend in FastAPI.

## Architecture-Change Process
Every architecture change must, in the same session:
1. Be recorded in an **ADR** (new, or a new ADR that supersedes an old one — ADRs are append-only).
2. Update this **ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md**.
3. Update **`../operations/RUNTIME_STATE.md`**.
4. Be recorded in **`../operations/AGENT_WORK_LOG.md`**.
5. Update relevant **`AGENTS.md`** files and service documentation.
6. Include **validation results** (the commands run and their outcomes).

## Architecture Change History

### 2026-10-19 — ADR-0018 Revision 2: full media architecture, purge instead of migration, session revocation
Proposed, not deployed (stacked on PR #89). Backend becomes the home of media jobs; historical Supabase portfolio photos and avatars are deleted, not copied; the Worker gains a content-addressed edge byte cache and the `media.aladdindecore.com` route; PostgREST refuses ended sessions on the next request; Vercel functions move to `cdg1` next to the database. See [Media Storage & Delivery](#media-storage--delivery).

### 2026-10-18 — R2 media store and ticketed edge delivery proposed (ADR-0018)
Proposed, not accepted and not deployed. R2 becomes the primary media store and a Cloudflare Worker serves R2 media with a per-request Postgres authorization, behind `MEDIA_EDGE_DELIVERY_ENABLED` (default false). See [Media Storage & Delivery](#media-storage--delivery) and [ADR-0018](../decisions/ADR-0018-r2-edge-media-delivery.md).

### 2026-10-18 — Local JWT verification for per-request session reads (WP8)
Middleware and read-only server loaders verify the session JWT locally (`getClaims`) instead of calling Auth `getUser` on every request; admin routes, account-security pages and privileged actions stay network-validated. Suspension enforcement is unchanged. See [auth-session-reads.md](../frontend/auth-session-reads.md).
Newest first.

### 2026-09-30 — Admin RBAC becomes the single source of platform authority
Admin Core Phase 1A ([ADR-0011](../decisions/ADR-0011-admin-rbac-platform-authority.md), Accepted; supersedes ADR-0007 D4). Each environment needs the one-time [Super Admin bootstrap](../admin/SUPER_ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP.md) before Roles management is operational. DB-backed roles/permissions/scoped assignments, SQL-enforced escalation safeguards, `platform_role_grants` demoted to a never-read bridge with a staged retirement, centralized frontend authorization with per-page route guards. Details: [`docs/admin/ADMIN_RBAC_ARCHITECTURE.md`](../admin/ADMIN_RBAC_ARCHITECTURE.md).

### 2026-09-28 — Email + Password is the canonical auth model
- **What:** `/auth/sign-up` (Full Name + Email + Username + Account Type + Password → Email OTP verification), `/auth/sign-in` (Email + Password) and `/auth/forgot-password/*` (Email OTP recovery; recovery `redirectTo` `<origin>/auth/forgot-password/reset`) serve the password flow; `/preview/auth-password/*` redirect there. Installer/technician Phone + Password (`/installer/*`, internal login alias) is unchanged and linked from `/auth/sign-in`. Supabase global CAPTCHA stays off; application-scoped Turnstile on Create Account, Resend Signup and Forgot Password request.
- **Supersedes:** the passwordless (WhatsApp/Email OTP) auth rule. The legacy email-OTP actions (`server/actions/auth.ts`, `/auth/recovery`) remain in the codebase.
- **Where:** PR #66; product decision in [PRODUCT_DIRECTION_GUIDE](../product/PRODUCT_DIRECTION_GUIDE.md) Change History 2026-09-28.

### 2026-09-28 — Raw authentication identifiers are internal (rule)
- **Rule:** Raw authentication identifiers (e.g. `auth.users.email`, which for an installer phone account is an internal login alias) are internal identity data and must not be passed directly to user-facing components. User-facing identity data must pass through a presentation-safe boundary — today `userFacingEmail()` in application code and `app.mask_email` in SQL, kept together as defense in depth. A server boundary that serves a flow which does not apply to an account (e.g. an email-only flow for a phone account) refuses that account before any identifier is read into a response.
- **Why:** Aladdin will support accounts with no usable email address — phone + password today; WhatsApp/SMS OTP and social providers later. Future UI must not assume `user.email` is the user-facing contact identity. (Documented only: no identity abstraction, provider table, OTP, social login, account linking or security settings were built.)
- **Details:** [`../frontend/installer-phone-auth.md`](../frontend/installer-phone-auth.md) → "Alias is never exposed".

### 2026-09-27 — Installer phone + password routes promoted
- **What:** `/installer/sign-up` / `/installer/sign-in` are the permanent installer entry point (`/temporary/craftsman/*` → 308 redirects in `next.config.ts`). `signOut` returns a phone-alias account to `/installer/sign-in` (identity read before sign-out); protected-route redirects stay on the shared `/auth/sign-in?next=…`, which offers a secondary installer link forwarding the validated `next`. Installer sign-in applies the exact `verifyEmailOtp` `next` rule. No schema change.
- **Details:** [`../frontend/installer-phone-auth.md`](../frontend/installer-phone-auth.md).

### 2026-09-27 — Temporary craftsman phone + password entry point
- **What:** Phone + password accounts via an internal login alias on the existing Supabase Auth email identity (no phone provider, no gate changes); one migration (`20260927090001`) makes `app.mask_email` return `•••` for the alias domain. Rollback-safe creation (admin delete on any initialization failure).
- **Why:** Unblock craftsman registration without enabling the hosted phone provider or widening the `email_confirmed_at` verified-caller gates (a production auth change).
- **Approved by:** User (Option B, 2026-09-27). Details: [`../frontend/installer-phone-auth.md`](../frontend/installer-phone-auth.md).

### 2026-10-26 — Supabase Auth verifies sign-in CAPTCHA (ADR-0023)
- **What:** Supabase Auth CAPTCHA protection (Turnstile) verifies the tokens of every operation it processes, Sign In included; app Siteverify only for the phone sign-up's Admin-API creation; the Installer password-change probe uses `account_password_confirm` instead of a password grant; CI runs the auth suites with `[auth.captcha]` on and calls `/auth/v1` directly to prove missing, forged, rejected and spent tokens are refused. **Supersedes the 2026-09-24 entry below.**
- **Why:** Since 05c4eec those tokens were forwarded to Supabase Auth with its CAPTCHA off, so they were only checked for presence, and the public key let anyone skip app-level checks.
- **Not yet in effect on hosted projects:** the owner enables CAPTCHA protection per project after this code is live there.

### 2026-09-24 — Application-scoped CAPTCHA (Cloudflare Siteverify)
- **What:** Turnstile tokens are verified by the app via Cloudflare Siteverify (fail closed) on Create Account and Forgot Password; Sign In's invisible CAPTCHA removed; `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` added server-only; `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_INVISIBLE_SITE_KEY` removed; `[auth.captcha]` permanently off.
- **Why:** With Supabase's CAPTCHA off, the previous wiring only checked that a token was non-empty — any string passed.

### 2026-09-24 — Registration persona assignment; workspace-independent profile settings
- **What:** The registration account-type RPC records Tradespeople/Sales as the declared persona (`app.effective_persona` added; `user_activities_set` and `my_profile_completion()` resolve through it); `/settings/profile` added as the user-identity surface with no workspace prerequisite; completion's organization-activities item is asked only of `org.manage` holders; locality removed from completion until a locality write path exists.
- **Why:** A registered Tradesperson was not recognised as a professional anywhere, and a business-intent user with zero organizations had no reachable identity editor — both made profile completion unreachable. No new table, state or permission.

### 2026-08-01 — Design System finalized & hardened (v1.0.0)
- **What:** Recorded the versioned Aladdin Design System ("The Aperture") as part of the architecture: added the *Design System (frontend)* section and the authority chain (`DESIGN.md` → `design/tokens/*.json` → `UI_UX_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` → `design.pen` → frontend). Canonical machine tokens, governance, component inventory, and icon policy added under `design/`.
- **Why:** The token/brand system is durable architecture; agents must consume canonical tokens rather than invent values. **No product feature, table, or connection was added.**

### 2026-07-30 — Architecture guide created; Python data access reconciled
- **What:** Created this current-state architecture guide. Reconciled the Python data-access approach to **`supabase-py`** and **deferred SQLAlchemy** (new ADR-0005 refining ADR-0002); SQLAlchemy removed from the backend scaffold as an unused dependency.
- **Why:** Give agents a single current-state reference distinct from the ADRs, and align the backend with the Private Pilot MVP data-access decision.
- **Validation:** see `AGENT_WORK_LOG.md` entry for 2026-07-30.

### 2026-07-29 — Foundation architecture accepted
- **What:** ADR-0001…0004 accepted; modular-monolith foundation scaffolded (Next.js + Supabase + specialized FastAPI + workers).
- **Why:** Stop re-deciding the stack per task; establish the isolation and migration spine before features.

## Showroom business onboarding persistence — 2026-10-14

Reuse business_creation_drafts / business_draft_save / business_draft_submit and the single organization creation transaction. Showroom contacts are unverified organization fields separate from authentication identity. Existing activities and organization_activities retain their identifiers; no new taxonomy. Primary branch address uses existing address_ar; optional during creation, later included in the shared profile-completion formula for eligible showroom owners. Existing approval, entitlement, type locks, grants and RLS remain authoritative. [Scope, tests and migration details](../frontend/showroom-business-onboarding.md).

## Showroom authentication and selling extension — 2026-10-14
ADR-0014 retains Installer identity/session architecture for Showroom. ADR-0015 documents DB-enforced business completion and private historical product/order continuation snapshots. Existing canonical wizard and transactional RPCs remain the only business-creation flow. Native GoTrue endpoints bypass application per-account quotas; a provider-wide mitigation is a merge/deployment blocker, documented in the feature report. Production impact/settings are unverified; no hosted mutation performed.

# PR #84 pending expand/contract correction — 2026-10-14

Business creation keeps its deployed nine-argument draft-save and draft-submit RPCs; extended Showroom callers use separately named v2 RPCs over the same transactional organization engine. Pending PR migrations add private generated country metadata and triggers so direct contact writes share application numbering rules. Historical address exceptions remain separate from current approval: expiry, rejection, revocation and suspension deny seller eligibility. These corrections are pending clean CI acceptance and are not deployed. [ADR-0016](../decisions/ADR-0016-business-phone-database-validation.md) records metadata provenance and refresh procedure. [Provider security research](../security/showroom-auth-provider-security-options.md) remains decision-only; no authentication provider or paid plan was changed.
